I. I NTRODUCTION

ISION-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP [1],
# V ALIGN [2], Flamingo [3], and LLaVA [4] have attracted

considerable attention from both academia and industry due
to their powerful cross-modal reasoning capabilities. These
models learn joint image-text representations from large-scale
datasets [5] and have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance and generalization across a variety of tasks. VLMs
have been successfully applied in diverse domains, including
autonomous driving [6], robotics [7], anomaly detection [8],
and cross-modal retrieval [9].
However, because the pre-training phase cannot capture
the full diversity of downstream tasks and environments,
adapting VLMs to specific applications remains a fundamental
challenge. Early efforts primarily relied on supervised finetuning [10]–[13], which explores more knowledge in annotated

examples. Despite their effectiveness, they still suffer from
high annotation costs and performance degradation under
distribution shifts [14] between training and test data. To
address these limitations, a growing body of work has explored unsupervised adaptation techniques [15]–[20]. These
approaches—often referred to as zero-shot inference [21]–

[23], test-time methods [18], [24], [25], or unsupervised
tuning [17], [26], [27]—aim to improve VLMs’ performance
in downstream tasks without relying on costly annotation.
Such methods have proven effective across a wide range of
applications, including image classification [15], [17], [18],
segmentation [16], [28], [29], medical image diagnosis [30],

[31], and action recognition [32], [33].
Given the rapid growth of this research area, this survey
provides a comprehensive and structured overview of existing
unsupervised adaptation methods for VLMs. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to introduce a taxonomy centered
on the availability of unlabeled visual data—an often overlooked yet practically critical factor in real-world deployment.
As illustrated in Fig. 1, we categorize existing approaches
into four paradigms: (1) Data-Free Transfer [15], [16], [21],
which adapts models using only textual class names; (2)
Unsupervised Domain Transfer [17], [34], [35], which utilizes abundant unlabeled data from the downstream tasks; (3)
Episodic Test-Time Adaptation [18], [24], [36], which adapts
models to a batch of test instances; and (4) Online Test-Time
Adaptation [19], [23], [25], which addresses the challenge
of streaming test data. This taxonomy provides a principled
framework for understanding the landscape of unsupervised
VLM adaptation, guiding practitioners in selecting suitable
techniques. We also believe our taxonomy will facilitate fair
comparisons across future work within the same paradigm.
The organization of this survey follows the structure shown
in Fig. 2. Sec. II provides an overview of several research
topics related to unsupervised learning in the context of
VLMs. Sec. III introduces zero-shot inference with VLMs

and presents a comprehensive taxonomy based on the availability of unlabeled visual data. The central focus of this
survey is discussed in Sec. IV - Sec. VII, where we analyze
existing approaches within data-free transfer, unsupervised
domain transfer, episodic test-time adaptation, and online testtime adaptation, respectively. Sec. VIII explores a variety of
application scenarios that utilize unsupervised techniques and
introduces related benchmarks, offering a broader perspective
on their practical implications and real-world utility. Finally,
we summarize emerging trends in the field and identify key
scientific questions that could inspire future work in Sec. IX.

eral surveys [37]–[40] have explored various aspects of unsupervised adaptation and fine-tuning of VLMs. Existing
works [40]–[42] predominantly focus on unimodal model
transfer, providing a thorough analysis of this domain, but they
offer limited coverage of VLMs. An early work [37] discusses
the pre-training stage of VLMs and briefly analyzes its finetuning method for vision tasks. Another survey [38] discusses
the adaptation and generalization of multimodal models, but
at a relatively coarse-grained level. A recent work [39] uses
generalization to understand VLMs’ downstream tasks and
reviews existing methods with a perspective of the parameter
space. While these surveys contribute valuable insights, our
work distinguishes itself by introducing, for the first time,
a taxonomy based on the availability of unlabeled visual
data and analyzing cutting-edge technologies in each of these
paradigms. We believe this is a novel and crucial contribution
to the field, especially in terms of the deployment of VLMs.

II. R ELATED R ESEARCH T OPICS

*A. Vision-Language Models*

Recent progress in VLMs has been remarkable, driven by
the integration of large-scale pre-training [1], [43], transformer
architectures [44], [45], and massive multimodal datasets [5],

[46]. Models such as CLIP [1], ALIGN [2], and Flamingo [3]
have pushed the boundaries by learning robust joint representations that bridge the semantic gap between vision
and language. These advancements have enabled impressive
performance across a range of tasks, including image captioning [47], visual question answering [48], text-to-image
synthesis [49], and cross-modal retrieval [50], often exhibiting
strong zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities. For further
information on vision-language models, we refer the reader to
the recent survey papers [37], [51].

*B. Zero-Shot Learning*

Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen classes
by leveraging semantic information such as attributes or word
embeddings. Early methods relied on learning compatibility
functions between visual features and manually defined attributes [52], [53]. Subsequent works introduced embeddingbased approaches that align visual and semantic spaces using


supervised objectives [54], [55]. To address limitations in
generalization, generative models were employed to synthesize
visual features for unseen classes [56]–[58]. Recent research
emphasizes generalized settings [59], [60], aiming to improve
robustness and fair evaluation across seen and unseen cate
gories. ZSL serves as a foundational principle for unsupervised
VLM adaptation, leveraging semantic descriptions (e.g., text
prompts) to bridge seen and unseen classes. This enables
models to generalize to novel visual concepts without requiring
any labeled examples. For further information on ZSL, we
refer the reader to the recent survey papers [61], [62].

*C. Supervised Fine-Tuning of VLMs*

Supervised fine-tuning of VLMs has emerged as a key
strategy to adapt pre-trained models to downstream tasks
with task-specific supervision. Researchers have increasingly
focused on parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques—such as
prompt tuning [10], [12], [63], adapter modules [64], [65],
and lightweight task-specific layers [66]—that allow models
to adapt to new domains while preserving the generality of
their pre-trained features. Moreover, some approaches use
large language models (LLMs) to aid in adapting VLMs [21],

[67] or adapt VLMs to dense prediction tasks [16], [68]. For
further information on supervised fine-tuning of VLMs, we
refer the reader to the recent survey papers [38], [69]. Instead
of relying on explicit label supervision, this survey focuses on
unsupervised VLM adaptation, where models must adapt to
downstream tasks without access to annotated data.

*D. Source-Free Domain Adaptation*

Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) addresses the practical setting where access to source data is restricted during
adaptation [70]. SHOT [71] initiates this paradigm by aligning
target features through information maximization and selfsupervised learning. The following works improve class-wise
feature structure via neighborhood clustering [72] and contrastive learning [73]. Other approaches leverage prototype refinement [74], self-training [75], and adversarial learning [76]
to enhance robustness. SFDA is closely related to unsupervised
VLM adaptation, as the original source data used to pretrain VLMs is often massive and impractical to access during

adaptation. For further information on SFDA, we refer the
reader to the recent survey papers [77], [78].

*E. Traditional Test-Time Adaptation*

Test-time adaptation (TTA) focuses on adapting a pretrained source model online to address distribution shifts

without access to source data or target labels. Online TTA
methods [79], [80] update specific model parameters using incoming test samples, leveraging unsupervised objectives such
as entropy minimization and pseudo-labeling. Robust TTA
methods [81], [82] tackle challenging real-world scenarios,
including label shifts, single-sample adaptation, and mixed
domain shifts. Meanwhile, continual TTA approaches [83],

[84] handle evolving distribution shifts encountered over time,
which is particularly relevant in dynamic real-world applications. Although most traditional TTA methods were introduced
for vision-only architectures, their core mechanisms, such as
entropy minimization and pseudo-labeling, have been repurposed for TTA of VLMs [18], [24], [85]. For a comprehensive
review of test-time adaptation, we refer readers to the recent
survey papers [40], [41].

III. P RELIMINARIES

**Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** typically consist of an
image encoder that maps high-dimensional images into a
low-dimensional embedding space and a text encoder that
generates text representations from natural language. Since the
introduction of CLIP [1], numerous improved models have
been proposed, including ALIGN [2], EVA-CLIP [86], and
SigLIP [87], with CLIP remaining the most widely used model
in existing works. CLIP is trained on 400 million image-text
pairs and aligns image and text embeddings using contrastive
loss. Given a batch of image-text pairs, CLIP maximizes the
cosine similarity for matched pairs while minimizing it for
unmatched ones. During inference, the class names of a target
dataset are embedded using the text encoder with a prompt of
the form “a photo of a [CLASS]“, where [CLASS] is replaced
with specific class names (e.g., cat, dog, car). The text encoder
then generates text embeddings **t** *c* for each class *c*, and the
prediction probability for an input image **x** with embedding
**f** **x** is computed as:

ex p ( cos ( **f** **x** *,* **t** *y* ) */* *τ* )
*p* ( *y|* **x** ) = � *Cc* =1 [exp (cos (] **[f]** **[x]** *[,]* **[ t]** *[c]* [)] *[ /τ]* [)] *,* (1)


where cos( *·, ·* ) measures the cosine similarity and *τ* is a
temperature parameter.
**Prompt Tuning.** Instead of relying on manually crafted
prompts, prompt tuning methods optimize prompts to improve
performance on downstream tasks. Specifically, prompt tuning
learns a prompt **p** = [ *V* ] 1 [ *V* ] 2 *...* [ *V* ] *M* *∈* R *[M]* *[×][d]* in the text
embedding space, where *M* is the number of tokens and *d*
is the embedding size. Given training data *D* train = *{* ( **x** *i* *, y* *i* ) *}*
from the downstream task, the objective is to generate text
inputs of the form “[ *V* ] 1 [ *V* ] 2 ...[ *V* ] *M* [CLASS]“ that provide the
model with the most relevant context information. For image
classification with cross-entropy loss *CE*, this optimization
can be formulated as:

**p** *[∗]* = arg min **p** [E] [(] **[x]** *[,y]* [)] *[∼D]* [train] *[CE]* [(] *[p]* [(] *[y][|]* **[x]** [)] *[, y]* [)] *[.]* (2)

**Taxonomy.** In this survey, we introduce a taxonomy that systematically categorizes unsupervised VLM adaptation methods
based on the availability of unlabeled visual data during the
adaptation process (Fig. 1). The proposed framework defines
four distinct adaptation paradigms, each with unique assumptions and challenges. The first, data-free transfer, represents
the most constrained setting where no visual data from the
downstream task is available. In contrast, unsupervised domain
transfer assumes access to an abundant, static collection of
unlabeled target data, enabling a more comprehensive, offline
adaptation before inference. The final two categories address
adaptation that occurs during the testing phase itself. Episodic
test-time adaptation operates on a small batch of test instances,
adapting the model specifically for that batch. Lastly, online test-time adaptation tackles the most dynamic scenario,
where the model must continuously learn from a sequential
stream of incoming data points and update itself in realtime. This taxonomy highlights the fundamental differences in
data access, computational constraints, and algorithmic design
across the spectrum of unsupervised VLM adaptation. In the
following sections, we provide a detailed overview of existing
approaches within each paradigm.

relies exclusively on textual category names to guide the adaptation process. As such, data-free transfer is considered the
most difficult paradigm within unsupervised VLM adaptation.
Despite these difficulties, methods developed for this setting
are often highly generalizable and broadly applicable, offering
robust solutions for a variety of unsupervised tasks across
domains where visual data is scarce, sensitive, or unavailable.
We review existing data-free transfer methods and categorize their strategies into three primary approaches: text
augmentation, image utilization, and network modification.
These categories are summarized in Table I, and we introduce
each strategy in detail along with related methods in the
following subsections.

*A. Text Augmentation*

In data-free transfer paradigm, where only class names are
available, direct inference results in the rich semantic capacity
of the text encoder remaining underexploited. To mitigate this
limitation, several methods have been proposed that enhance
the textual input through text augmentation, aiming to generate
more informative representations, as shown in Fig. 3 (a). These
augmented texts help unlock the latent knowledge of the text
encoder, thereby improving model performance despite the
absence of visual data.

Leveraging the powerful capabilities of LLMs, such as
GPT-3 [96], several data-free transfer methods [15], [21],

[97] have adopted text augmentation strategies to enrich class
representations with more informative and discriminative descriptions. These approaches aim to replace simple class names


with richer textual content, thereby improving alignment with
visual concepts. For instance, DCLIP [15] and CuPL [21]
use GPT-3 to generate multiple semantic descriptors and full
descriptive sentences, injecting discriminative knowledge into
category representations. REAL-Prompt [98] identifies performance drops for categories with low-frequency terms in the
pretraining corpus and addresses this by prompting ChatGPT

[99] to substitute them with higher-frequency synonyms that
are more familiar to the encoder. MPVR [97] introduces a
two-step prompting mechanism, where LLMs first generate
task-relevant queries that are then used to derive categoryspecific prompts, improving both relevance and diversity. In
domain-specific applications like medical image diagnosis,
ChatGPT [99] is used to generate symptom-based descriptions
of disease classes [31]. Moreover, Parashar et al. [100] show
that replacing scientific species names with common English
terms improves classification performance. Interestingly, reliance on LLMs is not strictly necessary. WaffleCLIP [101]
demonstrates that even random word augmentations to class
names can yield results comparable to those generated with
LLMs. In a complementary direction, TAG [102] proposes an
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection approach that leverages a
scoring mechanism based on permuted prompt templates. This
score captures consistency of model predictions across varied
phrasings and enables more accurate detection.

Extending this line of work, existing studies [32], [88],

[103], [104] have also explored the use of subclass names as
an alternative to rich textual descriptions, aiming to describe
the semantic scope of each category more precisely. CHiLS

[88] leverages GPT-3 [96] to generate subclass names for
each original class and makes final predictions by aggregating
similarities between the image and both the superclass and its
associated subclasses. In the context of semantic segmentation,
subclass prompts allow for finer-grained, patch-level alignment
with the target superclass, leading to measurable improvements
in performance [103]. For video-based action recognition,
TEAR [32] decomposes complex actions into multiple subactions, generating concise descriptions for each and forming
a robust composite representation by averaging their features.
Beyond subclassing, other approaches enrich semantic understanding through category-related attributes, helping to capture

nuanced intra-class variation and enhance image recognition
accuracy [104]. Furthermore, EOE [105] extends this strategy
to OOD detection by prompting LLMs to generate potential
OOD category names, thereby broadening the model’s recognition capacity beyond the training distribution.
Rather than classifying objects across all possible categories, some approaches [106]–[108] simplify the task by
organizing classes into clusters or hierarchical structures, decomposing a complex classification problem into a sequence
of hierarchical sub-tasks. An early work [106] constructs hierarchical clusters of candidate categories and employs ChatGPT

[99] to generate group-specific, discriminative textual descriptions. More recently, Lee et al. [107] leverage textual feature
similarity to identify semantically similar classes and then
prompt an LLM to generate visual descriptors that distinguish
a class from its nearest semantic neighbors. Moving beyond
accuracy alone, HAPrompts [108] introduces a hierarchical
classification framework to encourage the model to promote
better mistakes, encouraging the model to predict semantically
related labels when misclassifications occur.
Another line of data-free transfer methods [89], [109], [110]
leverage external textual data as a training signal to guide
models toward more robust task performance. For example,
TaI [89] replaces annotated images with rich textual descriptions for prompt tuning, introducing dual-grained prompts that
capture both global semantic context and local discriminative
features. In a related approach, TAP [109] constructs classspecific textual descriptions and trains a text-only classifier
using cross-entropy loss. This classifier is then integrated with
a visual encoder at inference time to enhance recognition
accuracy. Going a step further, ProText [110] optimizes deep
prompt parameters to steer the text encoder toward extracting
meaningful representations from LLM-generated descriptions,
which embed extensive linguistic knowledge and fine-grained
conceptual distinctions.

*B. Image Utilization*

In the absence of visual data, methods that rely solely on
textual information face inherent limitations, primarily due to
the modality gap that exists within VLMs. To bridge this gap,
a growing body of research [28], [91], [111] introduces visual
signals by either retrieving relevant images from external
datasets or synthesizing them using generative models, as
shown in Fig. 3 (b).
Retrieval-based methods attempt to provide visual grounding by leveraging large-scale unlabeled datasets. For example,
ReCo [28] retrieves semantically relevant images using CLIP

[1] from an external corpus and computes a reference image
embedding for each category. This embedding is then used
to guide the recognition of corresponding image patches and
refine the original zero-shot dense predictions. Neural Priming

[91] introduces a new classification head by computing the
centroids of retrieved image sets for each category from
the pre-training dataset, subsequently integrating this head
with the original zero-shot classifier to enhance recognition.
Generative approaches extend this direction by synthesizing
visual data to simulate examples for downstream tasks. For


instance, Shipard et al. [111] construct a synthetic training
set using diffusion models [49], generating a diverse set
of images that provide rich visual cues in the absence of
real data. AttrSyn [112] further boosts image diversity by
leveraging LLMs to generate a wide range of attributes, which
guide the generative model to produce class-consistent and
discriminative samples. SuS-X [90] combines both retrieval
and generation strategies by introducing a visual support set,
either constructed from large-scale datasets or generated via
advanced diffusion models [49]. This support set enables
information integration and provides auxiliary supervision
during inference. Finally, in the context of continual learning,
GenCL [92] generates synthetic images for novel classes
using prompt-guided diffusion models, and then introduces
an ensemble-based selector to curate a representative coreset
from the generated samples, supporting robust and effective
category representation over time.

*C. Network Modification*

Several data-free methods [16], [29], [93], [113] focus on
modifying the network architecture of VLMs to enhance their
suitability for downstream tasks, particularly dense prediction
such as segmentation, as shown in Fig. 3 (c). While these
approaches are primarily developed for classification-oriented
VLMs, their architectural enhancements significantly improve
dense prediction performance.
A pioneering work, MaskCLIP [16], demonstrates that value
embeddings in the final attention layers capture richer local
information than global features, making them particularly
effective for segmentation tasks. To further refine dense predictions from value embeddings, MaskCLIP introduces a keybased smoothing strategy and a denoising technique. Building
on this, CALIP [93] facilitates interaction between visual and
textual features through a parameter-free attention module,
and achieves improved classification results by ensembling
outputs from multiple feature representations. CLIP Surgery

[114] advances segmentation by introducing value-value attention to enhance local feature consistency and employing
a feature surgery strategy to suppress noisy activations, thus
improving both segmentation accuracy and interpretability.
GEM [115] generalizes value-value attention to an any-any
attention mechanism, enhancing consistency across groups
of similar tokens by ensembling outputs from the modified
attention applied to key, query, and value embeddings at every
transformer layer. SCLIP [94] introduces a correlative selfattention mechanism, which yields spatially covariant features
that better preserve fine local details. Finally, ProxyCLIP [95]
presents a training-free framework that enhances CLIP’s openvocabulary segmentation by integrating spatially consistent
proxy attention maps generated from vision foundation models
such as DINO [116] and SAM [117].

the unlabeled data of downstream tasks to better grasp the
data distribution and thus achieve better performance. The
challenges of this paradigm mainly come from the filtering and
processing of unlabeled data and the unsupervised alignment
of VLM and unlabeled data.

We review existing unsupervised domain transfer methods
and categorize their strategies into three primary approaches:
self-training, entropy optimization, and external resource utilization. These categories are summarized in Table II, and we
introduce each strategy in detail along with related methods
in the following subsections.

*A. Self-Training*

Self-training is a widely used strategy in unsupervised
learning, as shown in Fig. 4 (a), where the ground truth of
the training data is absent. Using this approach, unsupervised
algorithms always manage to calculate high-quality pseudo
labels on unlabeled samples as supervision signals. How to
obtain and iteratively refine pseudo labels to make VLM better
adapts to the distribution of the unlabeled data is the key
challenge for those methods.
UPL [17] is one of the earliest efforts to explore unsupervised domain transfer for VLMs. It selects a small set of highconfidence unlabeled samples for each category and optimizes
the prompt parameters using a pseudo-labeling strategy,

arg min **p** [E] [(] **[x]** *[,][y]* [ˆ][)] *[∼D]* [select] *[L]* *[CE]* [(] *[p]* [(] **[x]** [)] *[,]* [ ˆ] *[y]* [)] *[,]* (3)

where *D* select represents the selected high-confidence samples
and *L* *CE* denotes the cross-entropy loss. This selective pseudolabeling approach is later adopted by a number of subsequent


works [19], [120], [128], [129]. SwapPrompt [19] extends this
self-training strategy with another swapped prediction mechanism, letting the two augmented views of the same image
provide soft pseudo-label optimization supervision through
an EMA-updated prompt for each other. RS-CLIP [130]
introduces a curriculum learning framework, beginning with
a small subset of high-confidence samples for self-training
and progressively incorporating more data as optimization
progresses, thus mitigating the noise from early-stage pseudo
labels. GTA-CLIP [131] proposes a transductive inference approach to pseudo-labeling, using iteratively refined, attributeaugmented similarities between image and text embeddings
to improve label quality. In a related approach, CPL [132]
refines candidate pseudo labels by introducing both intra- and
inter-instance label to reduce the negative impact of incorrect
hard pseudo labels typically produced by VLMs. Another
work [133] systematically investigates pseudo-labeling strategies across several unsupervised settings and demonstrates the
effectiveness of pseudo-labeling in promoting more balanced
and robust performance across diverse categories.
Inspired by FixMatch [134], several unsupervised domain
transfer methods [118], [120] apply both weak and strong
augmentations to unlabeled data to enhance consistency learning in VLMs. These approaches typically generate pseudo
labels using the weakly augmented views and consider them as
supervisory signals for self-training on the strongly augmented
ones. LaFTer [118] leverages large language models (LLMs)
to generate diverse textual data for training a text classifier,
which in turn produces high-quality pseudo labels with weak
augmented views for effective self-training. MedUnA [30]
proposes a dual-branch architecture, consisting of weak and
strong branches for the visual encoder, and jointly optimizes
them using a pseudo-labeling objective to enhance medical
image classification. NoLA [129] employs a DINO-based
labeling network fed with weak augmentations to improve
pseudo-label quality for training visual prompts. DPA [135]
introduces dual prototype representations for both visual and
textual branches, integrating their outputs to generate more
robust pseudo labels. Additionally, LP-CLIP [136] incorporates confidence estimates into the pseudo-labeling objective,
thereby improving both classification accuracy and calibration.
Rather than filtering high-confidence samples and enhancing
consistency between different augmentations, there are also
some methods that generate pseudo labels in other ways.

JOURNAL OF L [A] TEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 7


MUST [26] maintains an EMA model to produce high-qulity
pseudo labels and incorporates a masked image modeling
strategy to improve local image representation learning. PEST

[122] enhances pseudo-label quality by ensembling predictions
from multiple textual prompts and visually augmented views.
ReCLIP [119] learns a projection space to better align visual
and textual features and employs self-training with pseudo
labels refined using Label Propagation [137]. NtUA [138]
constructs a confidence-weighted key-value cache of pseudolabeled features and refines it through knowledge distillation,
effectively mitigating label noise in scenarios with limited
unlabeled data. Similarly, TFUP-T [121] improves pseudolabel quality by building a cache model with representative
samples and refining predictions based on both feature-level
and semantic-level similarities. To address the issue of low
confidence pseudo labels, FST-CBDG [139] employs soft
pseudo labels and updates them using a moving average
strategy during self-training. For regression tasks, CLIPPR

[22] trains an adapter for the image encoder using zeroshot pseudo labels, optimizing performance by minimizing the
distance between predicted and prior label distributions.

*B. Entropy Optimization*

Entropy optimization is a classic unsupervised learning objective, encouraging the model to make confident predictions
on unlabeled data, as shown in Fig. 4 (b). Unlike self-training,
entropy optimization is not affected by erroneous pseudolabels and behaves more stably on low-performance tasks.
Many algorithms minimize sample-level entropy, adapting the
model to the unlabeled data distribution [34], [120], and
also maximize category-level marginal entropy to avoid mode
collapse [34], [120], [121].
POUF [34] and CDBN [120] optimize textual prompt
parameters with sample-level entropy minimization and
category-level marginal entropy maximization. An optimal
transport objective is also incorporated into POUF for better
alignment between the distribution of textual prototypes and
the unlabeled data. In order to improve both generalization
and out-of-distribution detection performance of VLMs, UEO

[27] proposes universal entropy, utilizing marginal prediction
instead of sample prediction for entropy maximization to
stabilize the optimization process.

*C. External Resource Utilization*

Several recent approaches enhance the performance of
VLMs by incorporating external resources beyond the available unlabeled data. These resources often include retrieval
based image augmentation, introduction of (multimodal) large
language models (MLLMs), and knowledge distillation from
powerful VLMs or vision models, as shown in Fig. 4 (c).
Neural Priming [91] adopts a transductive learning paradigm
by constructing a retrieval set of images based on category
names. For each unlabeled sample, it selects the most visually
similar images to form a fine-tuning dataset, thereby adapting
the VLM to the target domain. LaFTer [118] leverages GPT-3

[96] to generate diverse textual descriptions, which are then
used to train a text classifier tailored for the downstream task.


Similarly, PEST [122] and GTA-CLIP [131] query LLMs such
as GPT-3 [96] and LLaMA [140] to create multiple prompts
per class. These prompts improve pseudo-label quality through
ensemble-based prompt inference. LatteCLIP [141] utilizes
LLaVA [4] to generate image captions, which support more
accurate textual prototype construction for VLM adaptation.
In the context of knowledge distillation, PromptKD [123]
reuses textual features from a larger teacher VLM to guide
the training of an image encoder, thereby transferring semantic knowledge. Going a step further, KDPL [142] jointly
optimizes prompts in both visual and textual input spaces,
balancing performance and efficiency. NtUA [138] improves
pseudo-label reliability by incorporating the image encoder of
a stronger VLM, enhancing both label quality and confidence
estimation. OTFusion [124] aligns VLMs’ embedding with
features extracted from powerful vision models (e.g., DINO)
via optimal transport to obtain refined predictions.

*D. Miscellaneous*

There are also several recent approaches that address unsupervised domain transfer for VLMs through diverse strategies

[125], [143]. ZPE [144] designs a prompt ensembling strategy
that leverages unlabeled data to address frequency biases
in words and concepts and assigns appropriate ensembling
weights to multiple prompt templates. uCAP [145] formulates
image generation as a function of class names and latent,
domain-specific prompts. It employs an energy-based likelihood framework to infer optimal prompts from unlabeled
data. To enhance adversarial robustness while preserving performance on clean inputs, FARE [125] optimizes the vision
encoder to align the features of adversarially perturbed images
with those of their clean counterparts as computed by the original VLM. OTTER [126] addresses label distribution mismatch
by leveraging optimal transport to align model predictions
with an estimated label distribution in the target domain.
Moreover, InMaP [146] learns class proxies directly in the
vision space using refined pseudo labels derived from text
embeddings, thereby narrowing the modality gap between visual and textual representations in VLMs. Subsequent methods
exploit various strategies for modeling vision-text features,
including label propagation [35] and Dirichlet distributions

[147]. TransCLIP [127] proposes a plug-and-play transductive
framework that optimizes a KL-regularized objective with an
efficient block Majorize-Minimize algorithm, integrating the
text-encoder knowledge together.

**Paradigm description.** Episodic test-time adaptation is a
popular learning paradigm in which a pre-trained VLM is

in the pre-trained VLM to accurately predict labels for the
current batch, without requiring access to multiple test batches
or labeled data during adaptation.
We review existing episodic test-time adaptation methods

and self-supervised learning. These categories are summarized
in Table III, and we introduce each strategy in detail along with
related methods in the following subsections.

*A. Entropy Minimization*

Entropy minimization is a widely adopted strategy for
TTA [40] by adjusting the model’s parameters to make its output predictions more confident with lower entropy, as shown
in Fig. 5 (a). This process encourages the model to produce
low-uncertainty outputs for the test data, often improving its
performance under distribution shifts.
Shu et al. [18] introduced test-time prompt tuning (TPT)
as the first method for adapting pre-trained VLMs at test
time. TPT optimizes a text prompt **p** = [ *V* ] 1 [ *V* ] 2 *...* [ *V* ] *M* for
each test sample using entropy minimization, combined with
confidence selection to ensure consistent predictions across
augmented views. Specifically, TPT generates *N* randomly
augmented views of a test image **x** using a set of random
augmentations *A* and minimizes the entropy of the averaged
prediction probability distribution:


mask I[ **H** ( *p* *i* ) *≤* *η* ], where **H** denotes the entropy of predictions on augmented samples. Instead of applying random
augmentations as in TPT, DiffTPT [85], [162] leverages pretrained diffusion models to generate diverse augmentations and
employs cosine similarity-based filtering to remove spurious
samples. R-TPT [148] employs a reliability-based weighted
ensembling strategy to aggregate information from trustworthy
augmented views of the test sample. C-TPT [163] optimizes
prompts by maximizing text feature dispersion, observing that
better-calibrated predictions correlate with higher text feature
dispersion. O-TPT [164] improves calibration by enforcing
orthogonality constraints on class-specific textual prompt features during tuning to maximize their angular separation.
Furthermore, DTS-TPT [33] extends TPT to video data for
zero-shot activity recognition.
Beyond tuning text prompts to minimize entropy, several works also explore visual prompts [165], multimodal
prompts [24], low-rank attention weights [166], and learnable noise [167]. For example, PromptAlign [24] uses multimodal prompt learning to align image token distributions
between a pre-computed source proxy dataset and test samples.
TTL [166] adapts low-rank attention weights during test
time through a confidence maximization objective, enabling
efficient adaptation without altering prompts or backbone

parameters.

*B. Feedback Signal*

Some studies explore leveraging feedback signals from
diffusion [149] or CLIP-like models [150], [151] for TTA,
as shown in Fig. 5 (b). For example, Diffusion-TTA [149]
leverages generative feedback from diffusion models to adapt
pre-trained discriminative models at test time by optimizing
image likelihood, significantly improving performance across
tasks like classification, segmentation, and depth prediction.
Diffusion-TTA consists of discriminative and generative modules. Given an image **x**, the discriminative model *f* *θ* predicts task output *y* (Eq. (1) for VLMs). The task output
*y* is transformed into condition **c** . For image classification,
*y* represents a probability distribution over *C* categories,
*y ∈* [0 *,* 1] *[C]* *, y* *[⊤]* **1** *C* = 1. Given the learned text embeddings
of a text-conditional diffusion model for the *C* categories
**t** *j* *∈* R *[d]* *, j* *∈{* 1 *...C}*, the diffusion condition is **c** =
� *Cj* =1 *[y]* *[j]* *[ ·]* **[t]** *[j]* [. Finally, the generative diffusion model] *[ ϵ]* *[ϕ]* [ is used]
to measure the likelihood of the input image, conditioned on
**c** . This consists of using the diffusion model *ϵ* *ϕ* to predict


**p** *[∗]* = arg min **p** *[−]*

*p* ˜ **p** ( *y* *i* *|* **x** ) = *ρN* 1


*C*

� I[ **H** ( *p* *i* ) *≤* *η* ] *p* **p** ( *y|A* *i* ( **x** )) *.* (5)

*i* =1


Here, *p* **p** ( *y|A* *i* ( **x** )) represents the class probability vector for
the *i* -th augmented view of **x** under prompt **p** . TPT selects *ρ* percentile confident samples with a prediction entropy below a
threshold *η* to filter out noisy predictions, using a confidence

the added noise *ϵ* from the noisy image **x** *t* and condition **c** .
The image likelihood is maximized using diffusion loss by
updating the discriminative and generative model weights via
backpropagation:


*L* = *−*


encouraging the model to learn more robust class representations. The contrastive loss is formulated as:



*·* **t** *j*

*τ* �

1 *−* *α* ¯ *t* *ϵ,* **c** *, t* ) *−* *ϵ∥* [2] *,* (6)


where ¯ *α* *t* defines how much noise is added at each time step *t* .
Differently, RLCF [150] utilizes CLIP-based feedback through
reinforcement learning and employs CLIPScore [168] as a
reward signal to provide feedback for VLMs. BPRE [151]
mitigates text-conditioned bias by using a quality-aware reward module based on intrinsic visual features, forming a selfevolving feedback loop with prototype refinement to enhance
adaptation to distribution shifts.

*C. Distribution Alignment*

Distribution alignment methods align test sample distributions with known source characteristics or refine representations for improved consistency [169], as shown in Fig. 5
(c). For example, PromptAlign [24] bridges the source-totarget distribution gap by jointly updating multimodal prompts
to align the per-layer image-token statistics of augmented
test views with offline-computed source statistics through
a combined alignment and entropy minimization loss. To
enhance adversarial robustness, TAPT [152] adapts statistical
alignment by using a loss function that, at inference, aligns
the augmented visual embeddings of a test sample with precomputed statistics from both clean and adversarially perturbed images. StatA [153] preserves text encoder knowledge
during adaptation by utilizing statistical anchors that penalize
deviations from text-derived Gaussian priors.
Complementary to these approaches, MTA [36] employs
a robust MeanShift algorithm to identify density modes in
the feature space while concurrently optimizing them with an
inlierness score to automatically assess each view’s quality.
Beyond global distribution alignment, several methods focus
on class-aware prototype alignment. PromptSync [170] performs class-aware prototype alignment of the test sample with
source class prototypes, weighted by mean class probabilities
derived from confident augmented views. Also utilizing class
prototypes, TPS [169] pre-computes class prototypes and then,
for each test sample, dynamically learns shift vectors to adjust
these prototypes directly within the shared embedding space.

*D. Self-Supervised Learning*

Self-supervised learning [171], [172] is a powerful technique for learning transferable representations. Self-TPT [154]
introduces contrastive prompt tuning as a self-supervised
learning strategy, which aims to minimize intra-class distances while maximizing inter-class separation by leveraging
contrastive learning principles. Specifically, for each class
token, multiple prompt variations are generated by altering
the insertion point of the class token (e.g., beginning, middle,
or end of the prompt sequence). This creates positive pairs
from the same class and negative pairs from different classes,


where **t** *i* and **t** *j* are the projected text features of different
views, *P* ( *i* ) denotes the set of positive samples for view *i*, and
*τ* is a temperature parameter. In contrast, LoRA-TTT [156]
updates only the low-rank parameters in the image encoder
using a memory-efficient reconstruction loss, computed as
the mean squared error of class tokens from top-confidence
augmented and masked views, to enhance global feature understanding. In addition, InCPL [155] enables efficient model
adaptation by optimizing visual prompts from a few labeled
examples through a context-aware unsupervised loss and a
cyclic learning strategy. T3AL [157] generates and refines
temporal action proposals by first deriving video-level pseudolabels from a pretrained VLM, then using a self-supervised
method to create initial proposals, and finally enhancing them
with frame-level textual descriptions.

*E. Miscellaneous*

Beyond the previously discussed approaches, additional
techniques have been developed for episodic test-time adaptation of VLMs [173]–[180]. One line of work uses
retrieval-based strategies [159], [181], [182]. For instance, XMoRe [181] retrieves relevant captions via a two-step crossmodal retrieval and ensembles image and text predictions
using dynamically weighted modal-confidence scores. RATTA [159] utilizes fine-grained text descriptions to guide
a two-step retrieval of relevant external images, which are
then used in a description-based adaptation process to refine
the model’s initial prediction. Another line of work tries
to improve the calibration of VLMs [161], [163], [164],

[183]. Besides retrieval and calibration, other representative
work includes optimal transport [158], spurious features erasing [184], loss landscape [185], counterattack [186], and
supportive cliques [160]. Several methods focus on improving
CLIP’s dense prediction abilities for open-vocabulary semantic
segmentation by addressing its image-level pre-training limitations [28], [29], [103], [115], [187]–[189]. The external
knowledge, such as MLLMs and LLMs, can also be used
during inference, without requiring additional training or finetuning on task-specific data [190]–[197].

VII. O NLINE T EST -T IME A DAPTATION

**Paradigm description.** Online test-time adaptation is another TTA paradigm designed for *streaming data scenarios,*
*where unlabeled data arrives sequentially in mini-batches* .
Given a pre-trained VLM, the objective is to adapt the model
online to each incoming mini-batch in order to accurately
predict its labels under potential distribution shifts. Unlike
episodic adaptation, which adapts to each batch independently, online adaptation continuously updates the model by
leveraging knowledge accumulated from previously observed

mini-batches. This enables more effective and efficient label
prediction in dynamic, streaming environments.
We review existing online test-time adaptation methods
and categorize their strategies into three primary approaches:
pseudo-labeling, memory mechanisms, and distribution modeling. These categories are summarized in Table IV, and we
introduce each strategy in detail along with related methods
in the following subsections.

*A. Pseudo-Labeling*

Pseudo-labeling assigns class labels to unlabeled test samples and optimizes the cross-entropy loss between predictions
and pseudo-labels to guide model adaptation, as shown in
Fig. 6 (a). However, due to distribution shifts, pseudo-labels
may be noisy, which can negatively impact learning. Various
methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue. Many
methods refine the pseudo-labeling process itself; for instance,
IST [212] employs graph-based correction and non-maximum
suppression for pseudo-label refinement, stabilizing updates
with parameter moving averages. Others, like CLIPArTT [199]
dynamically construct text prompts from top- *K* predicted
classes to serve as pseudo-labels, while CLIP-OT [200] utilizes optimal transport for label assignment alongside multitemplate knowledge distillation. CTPT [213] focuses on iterative prompt updates guided by stable class prototypes
and accurate pseudo-labels. SwapPrompt [19] proposes a
dual-prompt and swapped prediction mechanism for efficient
prompt adaptation.
Several approaches enhance pseudo-labeling by integrating
it with other mechanisms. For instance, SCP [214] uses
self-text distillation with conjugate pseudo-labels to improve
robustness and minimize overfitting. WATT [201] combines
diverse text templates, pseudo-label-based updates with peri

odic weight averaging, and text ensembling. To handle noisy
target data, AdaND [215] introduces an adaptive noise detector
trained with pseudo-labels from a frozen model to decouple
noise detection from classification. DART [198] learns adaptive multimodal prompts (class-specific text and instance-level
image) while retaining knowledge from prior test samples.
ROSITA [216] employs a contrastive learning objective with
dynamically updated feature banks to enhance the discriminability of OOD samples. Finally, TIPPLE [217] adopts a
two-stage approach, first using online pseudo-labeling with an
auxiliary text classification task and diversity regularization
for task-oriented prompt learning, then refining this task-level
prompt with a tunable residual for each test instance.

*B. Memory Mechanisms*

Memory-based methods leverage dynamic or static memory
structures to store and retrieve feature representations and
pseudo-labels from test samples, as shown in Fig. 6 (b).
These methods enable progressive refinement of predictions by
utilizing confident outputs and historical information, enhancing robustness and adaptability without requiring extensive
retraining or backpropagation [218]–[221]. Inspired by TipAdapter [222], Karmanov et al. [25] propose a training-free
dynamic adapter (TDA) without requiring backpropagation.
The core of TDA is a dynamic key-value cache system
that stores pseudo-labels and corresponding feature representations from test samples. This cache enables progressive
refinement of predictions by leveraging confident test-time
outputs, facilitating efficient adaptation. Similarly, DMN [202]
leverages static memory for training data knowledge and
dynamic memory for online test feature preservation. BoostAdapter [223] leverages a lightweight key-value memory to
retrieve features from instance-agnostic historical samples and
instance-aware boosting samples. HisTPT [224] constructs
three complementary knowledge banks—local, hard-sample,
and global—to preserve useful information from previously
seen test samples. AdaPrompt [225] introduces a confidenceaware buffer that stores and utilizes only class-balanced, highconfidence samples to ensure the prompt updates are robust
and stable.

Other works utilize dynamically evolving class prototypes to
capture accurate multimodal representations during inference.
By continuously updating these prototypes from unlabeled test
samples, these methods enhance model adaptability, robustness, and efficiency [226], [227]. For example, DPE [203]
simultaneously evolves two sets of prototypes—textual and


-----

JOURNAL OF L [A] TEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 11


visual—to progressively capture accurate multimodal representations for target classes during test time. BaFTA [204]
uses backpropagation-free online clustering to estimate class
centroids and robustly aggregate class embeddings with visualtext alignment, guided by entropy-based reliability for improved zero-shot performance. BATCLIP [228] introduces a
projection matching loss to improve alignment between visual
class prototypes and text features, and a separability loss
to increase the distance between these prototypes for more
discriminative features.

*C. Distribution Modeling*

Distribution modeling methods model the distribution of
visual or multimodal features, often using Gaussian estimations, to refine predictions during inference [229]–[231],
as shown in Fig. 6 (c). By leveraging probabilistic frameworks and incorporating zero-shot priors, these methods enhance adaptability and robustness without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning or backpropagation. For instance,
OGA [205] models the likelihood of visual features using
multivariate Gaussian distributions and incorporates zero-shot
priors within a maximum a posteriori estimation framework.
Similarly, DOTA [206] estimates Gaussian class distributions
to compute Bayes-based posterior probabilities for adaptation,
achieves fast inference without gradient backpropagation, and
incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism to handle uncertain samples and enhance test-time performance. BCA [207]
continuously updates text-based class embeddings to align
likelihoods with incoming image features and concurrently
refines class priors using the resulting posterior probabilities.
On the other hand, DN [208] approximates negative sample
information using the mean representation of test samples,
enhancing alignment with the model’s optimization objective
without requiring retraining or fine-tuning.

*D. Miscellaneous*

Beyond the previously discussed approaches, additional
techniques have been developed for online test-time adaptation
of vision-language models [210], [232]–[234]. For instance,
DynaPrompt [209] mitigates error accumulation in online
adaptation by dynamically selecting and updating prompts per
test sample based on entropy and confidence scores, while
maintaining an adaptive buffer to add informative prompts
and discard inactive ones. ECALP [211] performs inference
without task-specific tuning by dynamically expanding a graph
over text prompts, few-shot examples, and test samples, using context-aware feature re-weighting to exploit the test
sample manifold without requiring additional unlabeled data.
OnZeta [23] sequentially processes test images for immediate
prediction without storage, using online label learning to
model the target distribution and online proxy learning to
bridge the image-text modality gap via class-specific vision
proxies. Besides, other representative work includes support
set [235], token condensation [210], prompt distillation [236],
and more [237]–[240].


VIII. A PPLICATIONS

*A. Object Classification*

Object classification serves as a fundamental task for
evaluating VLMs, where the objective is to assign a test
object image to one of the candidate category names. In
the context of unsupervised adaptation with VLMs, research
efforts primarily focus on two aspects: fine-grained generalization and robustness to distribution shifts. To assess finegrained classification performance, commonly used benchmark datasets include Caltech101 [241], OxfordPets [242],
StanfordCars [243], Flowers102 [244], Food101 [245], FGVCAircraft [246], SUN397 [247], DTD [248], EuroSAT [249]
and UCF101 [250]. To evaluate robustness against distributional shifts, researchers [18], [19], [101] often employ
ImageNet [251] along with its variants, such as ImageNetV2 [253], ImageNet-Sketch [255], ImageNet-A [252], and
ImageNet-R [254]. Additionally, several studies [27], [34]
incorporate datasets traditionally used in domain adaptation
to evaluate their methods, such as Office-Home [256], Office [14], and DomainNet [257].

*B. Semantic Segmentation*

Semantic segmentation aims to assign a semantic label
to each pixel in an image, playing a critical role in applications such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis. Unsupervised segmentation methods based on VLMs
primarily focus on general and fine-grained object segmentation benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC 2012 [258], PASCAL Context [259], COCO Stuff [260], ADE20K [261], and
COCO-Object [262]. In addition, complex scene understanding datasets such as Cityscapes [263] and KITTI-STEP [264]
are often employed to evaluate the performance of unsupervised segmentation approaches. To assess the ability to identify
rare concepts, some methods [28] utilize FireNet [265]. Moreover, researchers [16] explore robustness to corruptions [285]
to find out whether segmentation algorithms preserve the
inherent robustness of VLMs. Segmentation performance is
commonly quantified using the mean intersection-over-union
(mIoU) metric.

*C. Visual Reasoning*

Context-dependent visual reasoning aims to identify
whether a test image contains a given concept, based on a
small set of support images that include both positive and
negative examples. The Bongard-HOI [266] is commonly
employed to assess the capability of VLMs to abstract the
concept of human-object interaction from a limited number of
support examples and accurately classify test samples.

*D. Out-of-Distribution Detection*

OOD detection focuses on identifying whether a test sample
belongs to an in-distribution (ID) dataset composed of candidate categories, which plays a vital role in safety-critical
applications. Based on the degree of similarity between the
OOD and ID datasets, OOD detection can be categorized into
three main types: far OOD, near OOD, and fine-grained OOD

detection. Far OOD detection deals with samples that are
clearly distinct from the ID distribution. For instance, when
datasets such as CIFAR-100 [267], CUB-200-2011 [268],
StanfordCars [243], Food101 [245], OxfordPets [242], and
ImageNet [251] are used as ID data, datasets like iNaturalist [269], SUN397 [247], Places [270], and DTD [248] serve
as typical far OOD sources. Near OOD detection addresses a
more challenging setting where the OOD samples share visual
similarities with the ID data. Common experimental setups
include alternately using ImageNet-10 and ImageNet-20 as ID


and OOD datasets, as well as employing ImageNet-O [252]
and OpenImage-O [271] as near OOD sets. Fine-grained OOD
detection targets subtle distribution shifts within similar categories. For example, datasets such as CUB-200-2011 [268],
StanfordCars [243], Food101 [245], and OxfordPets [242] can
be split such that half of the classes are seen as ID data and
the other half as OOD data. Evaluation of OOD detection

performance is typically conducted using FPR95 and AUROC
metrics.

*E. Text-Image Retrieval*

Text-image retrieval is a fundamental task in visionlanguage research, where the goal is to retrieve relevant
images based on textual queries, or vice versa. The MSCOCO [262] and Flickr30K [272] datasets are among the
most widely used benchmarks for evaluating performance in
this domain. Besides, several specialized datasets are commonly utilized to assess retrieval performance across different
contexts, such as Fashion-Gen [273] from the e-commerce
domain, CUHK-PEDES [274], ICFG-PEDES [275] from the
person re-identification domain, and Nocaps [276] from the
natural image domain. Recall@K serves as the standard metric
for assessing the performance of retrieval algorithms.

*F. Image Captioning*

Image captioning aims to generate descriptive textual summaries of visual content. In the context of test-time adaptation, researchers [150] evaluate the adaptability of the CLIP
model across several benchmark datasets, including MSCOCO [262], Flickr30K [272], and NoCaps [276]. These
datasets provide diverse visual and textual contexts, enabling
the assessment of how effectively the model can generate
relevant captions when exposed to new domains without
additional annotated supervision. Captioning performance is
evaluated using BLEU, CIDEr, SPICE, and RefCLIPScore
metrics.

*G. Beyond Vanilla Object Images*

**Medical image diagnosis.** Medical imaging represents
a critical real-world application of VLMs in unsupervised
learning settings. Researchers [30], [31] frequently utilize
datasets such as the Guangzhou Dataset [277], Montgomery
Dataset [278], and Shenzhen Dataset [278], which focus on
chest X-ray diagnosis. Moreover, VLM-based unsupervised
methods [30], [31] have also been applied to various other
diagnostic tasks, including diabetic retinopathy [279], brain
tumor detection [31], and skin lesion classification [280].
**Videos.** Beyond static images, VLMs have also been explored in the context of video-based unsupervised learning.
Action recognition benchmarks such as HMDB-51 [281],
UCF-101 [250], Kinetics-600 [282], and ActivityNet [283] are
commonly used to evaluate performance. In addition, more
complex tasks like temporal action localization, which involve
both action classification and precise timestamp prediction,
are addressed using datasets such as ActivityNet [283] and
THUMOS14 [284].

IX. R ESEARCH C HALLENGES AND F UTURE D IRECTIONS

Despite significant progress, unsupervised VLM adaptation
remains an open and challenging problem. This section outlines key research directions, identifying gaps in the current
literature and discussing potential avenues for advancing the
field.


*A. Theoretical Analysis*

While existing research has largely focused on developing
effective unsupervised learning methods, rigorous theoretical
analyses are still lacking. Understanding the theoretical complexities of VLMs is crucial for developing more principled
adaptation methods. Future research can bridge this gap by
providing formal generalization guarantees and characterizing
the joint embedding space to explain how cross-modal alignment emerges [286].

*B. Open-world Scenarios*

Most existing approaches operate under the closed-set
assumption, which presumes identical label spaces across
domains. However, in real-world applications, test samples
often contain unknown classes, making it essential to detect
and handle them effectively. While some recent studies [27],

[215], [216] have begun addressing the open-world scenario,
this challenging yet practical setting remains underexplored.
Further research is needed to develop robust open-world
adaptation methods that can generalize across diverse domains
while accurately identifying unseen categories. Techniques
from out-of-distribution detection [287]–[289] could also be
leveraged and adapted to facilitate unknown class detection.

*C. Adversarial Robustness*

Although VLMs demonstrate strong generalization capabilities, they remain highly susceptible to adversarial attacks [290]. Several recent studies [290], [291] have drawn
inspiration from adversarial training techniques [292] to enhance the robustness of VLMs. However, these approaches
typically rely on large amounts of labeled data, leading to
substantial annotation costs. Therefore, an important research
direction is to explore robust optimization [125] and inference
strategies [148] under unsupervised settings, enabling VLMs
to operate reliably in complex, real-world environments where
adversarial threats are likely and labeled data is scarce.

*D. Privacy Considerations*

Privacy and security considerations are increasingly critical
for the adaptation of VLMs, particularly in sensitive domains
such as autonomous driving [293] and healthcare [294]. During adaptation, models may process proprietary or personal
data, raising concerns about data leakage and unauthorized
access. Additionally, the adaptation process can expose models
to adversarial attacks [292] that exploit vulnerabilities during the update phase, potentially degrading performance or
leading to harmful outcomes. To address these challenges,
future research should focus on developing privacy-preserving
adaptation techniques such as federated learning [295], which
enable models to adapt effectively without directly accessing
raw data.

*E. Efficient Inference*

The deployment of VLMs demands substantial computational resources for inference. A critical research challenge


-----

JOURNAL OF L [A] TEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 14


is to reduce their latency and memory footprint without
sacrificing performance. Future work may adapt techniques
like quantization [296], pruning [297], and knowledge distillation [298] for the unique cross-modal nature of these models.
The central difficulty lies in compressing the model while preserving the delicate vision-language alignments learned during
pre-training. Developing novel and efficient architectures is
crucial for enabling real-time VLM applications on resourceconstrained hardware and moving these powerful models from
the cloud to the edge.

*F. More VLMs Beyond CLIP*

While CLIP has become the de facto backbone for unsu
pervised learning of VLMs, relying solely on its contrastive
framework limits architectural and objective diversity. Future
research should investigate alternative base models—such as
advanced training strategies [87], masked-image modeling
with joint text encoders [299], or generative vision-language
transformers [300]—to uncover new inductive biases. Moreover, studying how different encoder-decoder pairings impact
alignment and transferability will guide the selection of more
versatile models. Broadening beyond CLIP will catalyze novel
unsupervised paradigms and improve VLM robustness across
tasks and domains.

*G. Extension to MLLMs*

Another promising research direction is to integrate TTA
into MLLMs with test-time scaling [301], [302]. TTA methods
enable models to dynamically adjust to distribution shifts
during inference, enhancing robustness without retraining. In
parallel, test-time scaling techniques allocate additional computational resources at test time—allowing models to ”think”
longer or perform deeper reasoning on challenging or outof-distribution inputs [303]. By merging these approaches, an
MLLM could not only adapt its predictions based on the
incoming data stream but also flexibly scale its inference
compute based on sample difficulty. This synergy would
offer a balanced trade-off between efficiency and accuracy,
especially in real-world applications where both rapid response
and high adaptability are critical.

*H. New Downstream Tasks*

Although unsupervised learning of VLMs has been extensively studied in image classification and semantic segmentation tasks, its potential in other domains remains largely underexplored, including regression [304], generative models [305],
cross-modal retrieval [306], depth completion [307], misclassification detection [308], and image super-resolution [309].
Besides, the potential applications in other fields such as
medicine [310] and healthcare [311] remain underexplored and
warrant greater attention.

*I. Failure Mode and Negative Transfer*

Despite the empirical success of many unsupervised adaptation methods for VLMs, few studies have systematically
documented their failure modes or reported instances of


negative transfer. For example, entropy minimization [18],
although widely used, can reinforce incorrect predictions when
the model exhibits high uncertainty, leading to overconfident
misclassifications or even mode collapse. Similarly, prompt
generation via LLMs may introduce hallucinated or domaininappropriate descriptions [312], resulting in semantic misalignment with the visual content and degraded performance.
In continual adaptation settings [83], the accumulation of
erroneous pseudo-labels over time can distort the feature
space and destabilize the adaptation process. To advance
the field, future research should place greater emphasis on
robustness analysis, including the development of metrics to
detect adaptation failures and best practices for identifying
and reporting instability. Furthermore, sharing negative results
or counterexamples can play a critical role in uncovering
systematic weaknesses and guiding the design of more resilient
and reliable adaptation pipelines.

X. C ONCLUSION

In this survey, we have presented a comprehensive and structured overview of the rapidly advancing field of unsupervised
vision-language model adaptation. Addressing a notable gap
in existing literature, we introduced a novel taxonomy that
classifies methods based on the availability of unlabeled visual
data, a crucial factor for real-world deployment. By delineating the field into four distinct settings—data-free transfer,
unsupervised domain transfer, episodic test-time adaptation,
and online test-time adaptation—we provided a systematic
framework for understanding the unique challenges and assumptions inherent to each scenario. Within this structure,
we analyzed core methodologies and reviewed representative
benchmarks, offering a holistic perspective on the state of the
art. Finally, we identified several key challenges and directions
for future research, including the development of theoretical
analysis, the handling of open-world scenarios and privacy
considerations, and further exploration of new downstream
tasks and application fields. This survey will not only serve
as a valuable resource for practitioners seeking to navigate the
landscape of unsupervised VLM adaptation but also stimulate
further innovation by providing a clear basis for comparison
and identifying promising directions for future research.
