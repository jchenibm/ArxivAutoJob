  "title": "The Missing Reward: Active Inference in the Era of Experience",
  "detailed_summary": "This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) is crucial for developing autonomous AI agents that can learn from experience without continuous human reward engineering. The current AI paradigm, relying on large human workforces for reward design, faces scalability challenges. The paper identifies a \"grounded-agency gap,\" where AI systems struggle to autonomously formulate and adapt objectives. It proposes that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy, enabling agents to balance exploration and exploitation. Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) as generative world models within AIF's framework can create agents that learn efficiently from experience while aligned with human values. This combination offers a path to truly autonomous AI systems adhering to computational and physical constraints.",
  "background": "The paper addresses the looming data shortage and the limitations of current AI systems. Existing AI relies heavily on human-generated data and reward engineering, facing resource saturation (data and compute limits) and hidden human dependencies (externalized cognition). The paper introduces the concept of an \"Era of Experience,\" where agents learn continuously through their own environmental interactions. However, it highlights that this paradigm still depends on extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This dependency undermines the goal of truly autonomous intelligence.",

  "problem": "The paper addresses the problem of the \"grounded-agency gap,\" which is the inability of contemporary AI systems to autonomously create, update, and pursue objectives as circumstances change. This gap arises from the reliance on external reward engineering and simulated environments (self-play), which do not translate well to open-world scenarios with fuzzy objectives, evolving preferences, non-stationary environments, and ambiguous feedback. The core challenge is enabling AI to interpret human guidance and environmental signals as flexible preferences and evidence, autonomously adapting to satisfy these evolving preferences in novel situations.",
