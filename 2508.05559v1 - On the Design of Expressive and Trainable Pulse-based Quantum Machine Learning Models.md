### 1 INTRODUCTION

Quantum computing holds substantial
promise for significantly improving the efficiency of both training and inference in
machine learning tasks [1, 2, 3, 4]. However,
in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum
(NISQ) era, the lack of error correction necessitates that quantum machine learning (QML)
collaborates with classical computers [5, 6]

[Re-Bing Wu: rbwu@tsinghua.edu.cn](mailto:rbwu@tsinghua.edu.cn)


through variational quantum models. In
this framework, quantum models execute the
inference task, while the classical computer
manages the training.
In the literature, variational QML models
predominantly employ gate-based parameterized quantum circuits, also known as quantum neural networks (QNNs) [7, 8]. Since all
gates are ultimately implemented through control pulses on the relevant physical qubits, recent proposals suggest that QML models may
be parameterized directly by these continuoustime control pulses instead of discrete-time
gate parameters [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].
In contrast to gate-based models, pulse-based
models are grounded in physical systems without abstraction, making them more accessible
to engineers due to their straightforwardness
and hardware efficiency [17, 18, 19, 20, 21].
In principle, within the finite coherence
time, pulse-based QML models are more expressive compared to their gate-based counterparts because they function as "infinitely"
deep data-re-uploading QNNs [22]. This advantage has been demonstrated in our previous study [22], where we also proved that
pulse-based models achieve full expressivity
(i.e., the ability to approximate arbitrary
functions [23, 24, 25, 26]) when the underlying quantum system is ensemble controllable. This criterion provides a controloriented framework for designing pulse-based
models, analogous to the design of universal
quantum computers [27]. Nonetheless, in systems comprising a large number of qubits, the
requirement for controllability becomes excessively stringent as it inevitably leads to barren plateaus within the loss landscape [28, 29].
This phenomenon results in an exponential de

cay of loss gradients (or, equivalently, the loss
variance [30, 31]) in the asymptotic temporal
limit [32] and the large qubit-number limit,
thus rendering optimization within large-scale
systems impracticable [8, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38].
A similar trade-off between expressivity and
trainability is observed in gate-based models,
where the loss function predominantly concentrates as the circuit attains greater expressivity [33, 39, 40].
To alleviate the conflict between expressivity and trainability, controllability must be
sacrificed in the design of pulse-based models. Larocca *et al.* [28] reveals that trainability is contingent on the degree of controllability characterized by the size and symmetry of
its dynamical Lie algebra. The findings indicate that a symmetry-restricted model has the
potential to circumvent barren plateaus, thus
providing a practical diagnostic approach for
the design of QML models. Building upon
this insight, a Lie-algebraic theory for barren
plateaus has been developed, based on which
an exact variance formula is derived for the

loss function. It is demonstrated that the

variance scales inversely with the dimension
of the dynamical Lie algebra, provided that
either the initial state or observable is contained within the Lie algebra [41, 42]. Diaz
*et al.* [43] extends beyond the Lie-algebraic
framework by analyzing parameterized matchgate circuits. By decomposing the operator
space into Lie group modules, they derive an
exact variance formula for loss functions applicable to arbitrary initial states and observables, demonstrating that barren plateaus can
emerge from generalized global operators and
are dependent on module dimensions rather
than solely on the dimension of the dynamical
Lie algebra.
The existing literature provides a Lie algebraic framework for evaluating the trainability of uncontrollable pulse-based QML models induced by dynamic symmetry, but the expressivity of these models remains ambiguous.
In the present study, we demonstrate that an
ill-suited selection of either the initial state

or the measurement observable can result in

the loss of expressivity, and conduct a sys

tematic analysis on the expressivity of pulsebased QML models within the context of dynamic symmetry. In contrast to the Fourierseries analysis typically used to assess the expressivity of data-reuploading gate-based models [44, 45, 46, 47, 48], we utilize the polynomial expansion of nonlinear functions epitomized by the pulse-based model based on
Dyson-series analysis (also known as Fliessseries in control theory for input-output analysis of nonlinear systems [49]). This analysis
yields a Lie algebraic tool for the design of
expressive pulse-based models with dynamic

symmetry.
The structure of the paper is as follows:
Section 2 introduces essential background on
pulse-based QML models and the existing results on the trainability under dynamic symmetry. Section 3 analyzes the expressivity of
pulse-based models through the Dyson-series
expansion from which a necessary condition is
derived. In Section 4, numerical experiments
are conducted to demonstrate the expressivity
of pulse-based models with dynamic symmetry, and the balance between expressivity and
trainability. Finally, Section 5 draws the conclusion and future perspectives.
### 2 PULSE-BASED QML MODELS with dynamical symmetry

We first illustrate the potential advantages
of pulse-based QML models through a fourqubit system. In the gate-based data reuploading model shown in Fig. 1(a), the input
**x** = ( *x* 1 *, x* 2 *, x* 3 *, x* 4 ) is repeatedly uploaded using the encoding circuits *U* ( **x** ) = *R* z ( *x* 1 ) *⊕· · ·⊕*
*R* z ( *x* 4 ) . The trainable circuit blocks comprise
*R* y ( *θ* *k* ) ( *k* = 1 *, · · ·, n* ) rotations about the y axis, interspersed with the data-uploading circuit blocks. The final learning outcome is inferred by the expectation-value measurement

*f* ( **x** *,* Θ) = *⟨ψ* ( **x** *,* Θ) *|M* *|ψ* ( **x** *,* Θ) *⟩* (1)

of a specific observable *M*, where *|ψ* ( **x** *,* Θ) *⟩* is
the output state of the circuit, to approximate
multivariable functions by optimizing the parameters Θ = *{θ* 1 *, · · ·, θ* *n* *}* .

Figure 1: Schematics of (a) a four-qubit gate-based data re-uploading QML model, (b) the pulse-based model
compiled from the circuit, and (c) the generalized pulse-based model.


Figure 1(b) illustrates that the physical implementation of the quantum circuit
model consistently compiles individual quantum gates into time-varying control pulses on
the physical qubits. Let *x* *k* ( *t* ) and *θ* *k* ( *t* ) represent the corresponding data-encoding and
training control pulses applied to the *k* th qubit.
The QML process can be adjusted by Θ =
*{θ* 1 ( *t* ) *, · · ·, θ* *n* ( *t* ) *, t ∈* [0 *, T* ] *}*, resulting in a
pulse-based model implemented at the physical level. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1(c),
the pulses can be continuously and simultaneously applied without waiting for one another,
allowing for compression to reduce inference
time. Such generalized pulse-based model is
free from a prior circuit design, featuring more
tunable parameters within the finite coherence
time, and can achieve greater expressive power
than gate-based models [22].
The pulse-based model implemented with
an *n* -qubit quantum device can be characterized as a controlled quantum system:

*|ψ* [˙] ( *t* ; **x** ) *⟩* = *−i* [ *H* E ( *t,* **x** ) + *H* C ( *t* )] *|ψ* ( *t* ; **x** ) *⟩* *,*
(2)
in which the encoding Hamiltonian


can be trained to fit the dataset. Similar
to gate-based models, the output is inferred
through the expectation-value measurement

*f* ( **x** *,* Θ) = *⟨ψ* ( *T* ; **x** ) *|M* *|ψ* ( *T* ; **x** ) *⟩* (5)

with Θ = *{θ* 1 ( *t* ) *, · · ·, θ* *m* + *p* ( *t* ) *, t ∈* [0 *, T* ] *}* . In
practice, certain control pulses may be constant or exhibit limited tunability due to hard
ware constraints.
Let g = *{iH* 1 *, · · ·, iH* *m* + *p* *}* *LA* be the Lie algebra generated by data-encoding and control
Hamiltonians in (2), and

g = c *⊕* g 1 *⊕· · · ⊕* g *k*

be its decomposition as a direct sum of commuting ideals, where c is the center of g and
g 1 *⊕· · · ⊕* g *k* is the semi-simple part. Assume
that either the initial state *ρ* = *|ψ* 0 *⟩⟨ψ* 0 *|* or
the observable *M* belongs to the Lie algebra
g (a relaxed condition can be found in [43]),
and the QNN is sufficiently deep (i.e., a sufficiently long time duration *T* for pulse-based
QNN) to establish a 2 -design over the Lie
group *e* [g] [41, 42]). The variance of *f* ( **x** *,* Θ) can
be estimated as follows [41, 29]

(the complexification of g). *{B* *j* *}* [dim(] *j* =1 [g][)] is an
orthonormal basis for g.
The formula (6) indicates that the model
becomes untrainable when the underlying control system is fully controllable, because in
such case dim ( g ) = 4 *[n]* with g = su (2 *[n]* ),
yielding exponentially decreasing variance as
*n* increases. Therefore, non-trivial dynamic
symmetry must be introduced to constrain
the quantum state evolution to a manifold
whose dimension does not increase exponentially with *n* .
### 3 EXPRESSIVITY OF QML MOD- ELS in presence of dynamical symme- try

The pulse-based model (2) is said to be expressive if, for any function *f* 0 ( **x** ) and a specified error threshold *ϵ >* 0, there exists a suitable control pulse Θ and a scaling factor *θ* 0
such that the measurement-induced function
(5) can approximate the function with the desired precision, i.e., *∥θ* 0 *f* ( **x** *,* Θ) *−* *f* 0 ( **x** ) *∥* *< ϵ* .
In a previous study [22], we demonstrated
that a pulse-based model is expressive when
the underlying system is ensemble controllable
(i.e., any *|ψ* ( *T* ; **x** ) *⟩* as a function of **x** can be realized within a sufficiently long time *T* ). This
condition guarantees expressivity for arbitrary
selections of the initial state *|ψ* 0 *⟩* and the measurement observable *M* . However, as previously noted, it is overly stringent for trainability.


In the following, we demonstrate that such
uncontrollable pulse-based models can be expressive when the initial state and measurement observable are appropriately selected.
To derive the required condition, we expand
the output function (5) into a polynomial series of **x** . For convenience, we first rewrite (2)
as a Liouville equation:

*ρ* ˙( *t* ) = *L* ( *t* ) *ρ* ( *t* ) *,* *ρ* (0) = *|ψ* 0 *⟩⟨ψ* 0 *|,* (7)

where *ρ* ( *t* ) = *|ψ* ( *t* ) *⟩⟨ψ* ( *t* ) *|* is the density matrix
of the system, and


*m* + *p*
� *θ* *j* ( *t* ) *L* *j* *,* (8)

*j* = *m* +1


*L* ( *t* ) =


*m*
� *x* *j* *θ* *j* ( *t* ) *L* *j* +

*j* =1


with the Liouvillian defined as *L* *j* *X* =
*−i* [ *H* *j* *, X* ] for *j* = 1 *, · · ·, m* + *p* .
We then apply the Dyson series expansion
(also known as the Fliess expansion in control
theory literature [49]):

*t*
*ρ* ( *t* ) = *ρ* (0) + *L* ( *t* 1 ) *ρ* (0)d *t* 1
� 0


*t*

� 0


*t* 1

*L* ( *t* 2 ) *ρ* (0)d *t* 2 + *· · · .*

� 0


By substituting (8) and expanding the series
into polynomial terms of *x* 1 *, · · ·, x* *m*, we obtain the following polynomial expansion:

*f* ( **x** *,* Θ) = tr [ *ρ* ( *T* ) *M* ]

= � *C* *k* 1 *,···,k* *m* (Θ) *x* *[k]* 1 [1] *[· · ·][ x]* *m* *[k]* *[m]* *[,]*

*k* 1 *,···,k* *m* *≥* 0

where


� *c* *j* 1 *···j* *n* (Θ) *⟨ψ* 0 *|L* *j* 1 *· · · L* *j* *n* *M* *|ψ* 0 *⟩.* (9)

index *j* in *{* 1 *, · · ·, m}* appears *k* *j* times. The

strates the inherent nonlinearity in the
model induced by a continuous-limit datareuploading mechanism [22]. It is evident
that the pulse-based model can approximate
any continuous function if the coefficients
*{C* *k* 1 *,···,k* *m* (Θ) *}* in the polynomial series are
fully adjustable by tuning the control pulses
*θ* 1 ( *t* ) *, · · ·, θ* *m* + *p* ( *t* ) . According to (9), the adjustability of these coefficients depends on
both the control pulses, through *c* *j* 1 *···j* *n* (Θ)
terms, and the initial state and observable
through *⟨ψ* 0 *|L* *j* 1 *· · · L* *j* *n* *M* *|ψ* 0 *⟩* terms.
Ideally, if the coefficients *c* *j* 1 *···j* *n* (Θ) are mutually independent and fully adjustable, the
model is expressive provided that, for each
( *k* 1 *, · · ·, k* *m* ), there exist some ( *j* 1 *, · · ·, j* *n* ) *∈*
J *k* 1 *,···,k* *m* such that *⟨ψ* 0 *|L* *j* 1 *· · · L* *j* *n* *M* *|ψ* 0 *⟩̸* = 0 .
Unfortunately, the mutual independence of
*c* *j* 1 *···j* *n* (Θ) does not hold, as it can be negated
by the counterexample

*c* *j* 1 *j* 2 (Θ) + *c* *j* 2 *j* 1 (Θ) = *c* *j* 1 (Θ) *c* *j* 2 (Θ) *,* *∀* *i, j.*

Nevertheless, we can derive a necessary
condition from this analysis. Observing
that the coefficient *C* *k* 1 *···k* *m* (Θ) corresponding to the monomial *x* *[k]* 1 [1] *[· · ·][ x]* *m* *[k]* *[m]* vanishes
when *⟨ψ* 0 *| L* *j* 1 *· · · L* *j* *n* *M |ψ* 0 *⟩* = 0 holds for all
( *j* 1 *, · · ·, j* *n* ) *∈* J *k* 1 *,···,k* *m*, we can conclude that
the model loses expressivity under these circumstances, regardless of the adjustability of
all *c* *j* 1 *···j* *n* (Θ) . This can be summarized as the
following necessary condition for model expressivity.

**Theorem 1** *Given a sufficiently long dura-*
*tion* *T* *, the pulse-based QML model* (2) *can*
*approximate any function* *f* : *X* *→* R
*only when* *⟨ψ* 0 *| L* *j* 1 *· · · L* *j* *n* *M |ψ* 0 *⟩̸* = 0 *for all*
( *j* 1 *, · · ·, j* *n* ) *∈* J *k* 1 *,···,k* *m* *}* *and all* *k* 1 *, · · ·, k* *m* *≥*
0 *.*

To facilitate the validation of this condition,
we denote by

*S* *k* 1 *,···,k* *m* = *{L* *j* 1 *· · · L* *j* *n* *M,* ( *j* 1 *, · · ·, j* *n* ) *∈* J *k* 1 *,···,k* *m* *}*

the set of operators associated with the coefficient of *x* *[k]* 1 [1] *[· · ·][ x]* *m* *[k]* *[m]* [and introduce a recursive]
procedure for their evaluation. We first define

M( *S* ) = span *m* + 1 *{L* *α* *≤* 1 *· · · Lα* *i* *≤* *α* *ℓ* *mX, X* + *p, ℓ ∈S∈,* N *}* [(11)]


the submodule generated by the operator set
*S* with the control Liouvillians. By definition,
it is apparent that

*S* 0 *,···,* 0 = M( *M* )

because J 0 *,···,* 0 contains only tuples ( *j* 1 *· · ·, j* *n* )
with *m* + 1 *≤* *j* *k* *≤* *m* + *p* . Starting from
*S* 0 *,···,* 0, we can recursively construct *S* *k* 1 *,···,k* *m*
as follows:

*S* *k* 1 *,···,k* *i* *,···,k* *m* = M ( *L* *i* *S* *k* 1 *,···,k* *i* *−* 1 *,···,k* *m* ) *.*

Theorem 1 provides a method for identifying candidate pulse-based QML models that
are both trainable and expressive. Although
the sufficiency for expressivity cannot be rigorously proven, subsequent numerical simulations will demonstrate that models meeting
this condition tend to be highly expressive.
This is attributed to the infinite number of
*c* *j* 1 *···j* *n* (Θ) terms in (9), which offer considerable flexibility even if they are not mutually
independent.
### 4 Numerical Simulations

In this section, we demonstrate through numerical simulations the expressivity and trainability of pulse-based QML models under selected dynamic symmetries.
Given a training dataset *{* ( **x** [(] *[k]* [)] *, y* [(] *[k]* [)] ) *}* that
contain *N* samples, the model is trained by
minimizing the loss function


(12)
where Θ = *{θ* 1 ( *t* ) *, · · ·, θ* *m* + *p* ( *t* ) *}* . The scaling
factor *θ* 0 is introduced to adapt the function
represented by the model to the range of the
dataset. Without loss of generality, the domain of **x** is always set as *X* = [ *−* 1 *,* 1] *[m]* [22].
In the numerical simulations, the control
pulses are chosen in a piecewise-constant form.
Each control pulse is divided into *K* subpulses, analogous to the number of layers in
gate-based QNN models, with the sub-pulse
amplitudes used to parameterize the model. In

all simulations, the sampling period is set to

by Adam optimizer [50] with a learning rate
of 0 *.* 05 . The simulations are conducted using
MATLAB on a computer equipped with two
10-core Xeon CPUs and 208 GB RAM.
#### 4.1 Expressivity of pulse-based models with dynamical symmetry

For the convenience of model description, we
adopt the following notation

*σ* *α* [(] *[k]* [)] = I 2 *⊗· · · ⊗* *σ* *α* *⊗· · · ⊗* I 2 *,* *α* = x *,* y *,* z *,*

for Pauli operators located on the *k* th site in
an *n* -qubit system.
We first demonstrate the approximation of
univariate functions using a two-qubit model:

*H* [ *x* ; Θ] = *xσ* z [(1)] *[σ]* z [(2)] + *θ* 1 ( *t* ) *σ* x [(1)] + *θ* 2 ( *t* ) *σ* x [(2)] *[.]*
(13)
The system is not controllable as it possesses a
six-dimensional dynamical symmetry algebra:

g = *{σ* z [(1)] *[σ]* z [(2)] *[, σ]* x [(1)] *[, σ]* x [(2)] *[}]* *[LA]* [=][ so][(4)] *[ ⊂]* [su][(4)] *[.]*
(14)
We choose the observable *M* = *σ* z [(1)] *[σ]* z [(2)] and it

can be calculated that

*S* 2 *k* = *{σ* z [(1)] *[σ]* z [(2)] *[, σ]* y [(1)] *[σ]* z [(2)] *[, σ]* z [(1)] *[σ]* y [(2)] *[, σ]* y [(1)] *[σ]* y [(2)] *[}][,]*

� *√* 2 5 *[|]* [0] *[⟩]* [+] *√* 1 5 *[|]* [1] *[⟩]* � *⊗|* 0 *⟩* . However, when the ini
tial state is *|ψ* 0 *⟩* = *|* 0 *⟩⊗|* 0 *⟩*, the model can
only approximate the even part of *f* 0 ( *x* ) due
to the violation of the necessary condition in
Theorem 1.

We also test the fitting of other randomly
selected functions, which can all be approximated by the model, provided that the pulse
duration is sufficiently long. The required
pulse durations tend to be longer when the
target function exhibits greater curvature or
includes many higher-order power terms.
We further examine the approximation capability of pulse-based models for more complex bivariate functions using the following
Hamiltonian:

from which 200 points are evenly sampled
across *X* = [ *−* 1 *,* 1] to train the model with

quantum machine learning (QML) model accurately fit the target function when *|ψ* 0 *⟩* =

According to Theorem 1, if the system is
initialized in the state *|ψ* 0 *⟩* = *|* 0 *⟩⊗|* 0 *⟩*, as
is typically done, all odd power terms of *x*
will vanish because *⟨ψ* 0 *| S* 2 *k* +1 *|ψ* 0 *⟩* = *{* 0 *}* for
all *k ∈* N. This implies that such a model
can only approximate even functions. However, if the initial state is altered to *|ψ* 0 *⟩* =
� *√* 2 5 *[|]* [0] *[⟩]* [+] *√* 1 5 *[|]* [1] *[⟩]* � *⊗|* 0 *⟩*, one can verify that


� *√* 2 5 *[|]* [0] *[⟩]* [+] *√* 1 5 *[|]* [1] *[⟩]* � *⊗|* 0 *⟩*, one can verify that

*⟨ψ* 0 *| S* *k* *|ψ* 0 *⟩̸* = *{* 0 *}* holds for all *k ∈* N, suggesting that the model has the potential to
approximate any univariate function.
To validate the above prediction, we apply
the model (13) to approximate the following
randomly selected target function:

5 *[|]* [0] *[⟩]* [+] *√*


*f* 0 ( *x* ) = 2 *x* + 3 *x* [2] + *x* [3] + 10 *x* [6]

+ *θ* 3 ( *t* ) *σ* x [(1)] + *θ* 4 ( *t* ) *σ* x [(2)] *[,]*

also exhibits so (4) dynamic symmetry, and it
can be computed that

*S* *k* 1 *,k* 2 = *{σ* y [(1)] *[, σ]* y [(2)] *[, σ]* z [(1)] *[, σ]* z [(2)] *[}]* (17)

for all cases where *k* 1 + *k* 2 is even, and

*S* *k* 1 *,k* 2 = *{σ* x [(1)] *[σ]* y [(2)] *[, σ]* y [(1)] *[σ]* x [(2)] *[, σ]* x [(1)] *[σ]* z [(2)] *[, σ]* z [(1)] *[σ]* x [(2)] *[}]*
(18)
for all cases where *k* 1 + *k* 2 is odd. Accordingly,
the initial state is designated as *|ψ* 0 *⟩* = *√* 1 2 *[|]* [0] *[⟩⊗]*

( *|* 0 *⟩* + *|* 1 *⟩* ), which can be verified to satisfy the
necessary condition in Theorem 1.
In the simulation, the target function is selected as

*f* 0 ( *x* 1 *, x* 2 ) = ( *x* [2] 1 [+] *[x]* [2] *[−]* [3)] [2] [+(] *[x]* [1] [+] *[x]* 2 [2] *[−]* [1)] [2] [ (19)]

with 50 *×* 50 = 2500 data points evenly sampled across the domain *X* = [ *−* 1 *,* 1] *×* [ *−* 1 *,* 1]
and the pulse duration *T* increased from 0 *.* 5

to 4.

For comparison, we train two pulse-based
models. In the first case, we set the control pulses *θ* 1 ( *t* ) = *θ* 2 ( *t* ) *≡* 1, which considerably limits the tunability of the coefficients
*C* *k* 1 *k* 2 (Θ) . As illustrated in Fig. 3(a), the fitting progressively aligns with the surface of the
target bivariate function as *T* increases; however, the precision remains limited no matter
how *T* is prolonged. In the second case, we
allow *θ* 1 ( *t* ) and *θ* 2 ( *t* ) to vary to enhance the
tunability of coefficients *C* *k* 1 *k* 2 (Θ), thereby releasing more expressivity compared to the first
case. The fitting results in Fig. 3(b) validate
this expectation, as it nearly perfectly matches
the target surface when *T* = 4, with a fitting
error of *L* (Θ) *≤* 10 *[−]* [3] .
#### 4.2 The balance between expressivity and trainability

The simulations above demonstrate that pulsebased models can be expressive when uncontrollable due to dynamic symmetry. This establishes a framework for the design of largescale pulse-based QML models that are both
expressive and trainable. Subsequently, we
select four classes of multi-qubit pulse-based
models that exhibit various dynamic symme
tries.

with 3 *n* control pulses. The observable is selected as *M* = *σ* z [(1)] and the initial state as
*|ψ* 0 *⟩* = *|* 0 *⟩* *[⊗][n]* .
The initial states and measurement observ

model Hamiltonian:

*H* 1 [ *x* ; Θ] = *xJ* z + *θ* 1 ( *t* ) *J* x + *θ* 2 ( *t* ) *J* y (20)

with two control pulses, where

g = *{iJ* x *, iJ* y *, iJ* z *}* *LA* = su(2)

is the 2 *[n]* -dimensional unitary irreducible representation of su (2) (see the detailed description
in appendix). In this case, the observable is
chosen as *M* = 2 *[n]* 2 *−* 1 *[J]* [z] [ and the initial state is]
chosen as *|ψ* 0 *⟩* = *|* 0 *⟩* *[⊗][n]* .

from Ref. [51] that possesses so ( *n* ) dynamic

necessary condition in Theorem 1 for expressivity. In addition, the observables are selected
from the associated Lie algebra g for the sake
of trainability [41]. The theoretical variance
of the measurement output (5) is presented in
Tab. 1 (see the appendix for detailed calculations), which indicates that the variance is
inversely proportional to the dimension of the
dynamic Lie algebra g.
During the numerical simulations, these
models were trained to fit the univariate function (15). Due to the limitation of computational resource, we use up to six qubits. As
can be seen in the inset figure of Fig. 4(a),
each model can approximate the target function with arbitrarily small error when the pulse
duration *T* is sufficiently extended. This indicates that the model expressivity grows with
*T*, and thus provides a measure to quantify
the degree of expressivity. Here, we adopt the
minimal pulse duration required for the training loss to fall below 10 *[−]* [3] to evaluate the expressivity (see the inset for illustration).
Based on this measure, the simulation results in Fig. 4(a) compare the variation of expressivity with respect to system size across
the four model classes. It is observed that,
except the special case of su (2) whose dimensionality is constant, the expressivity can be
enhanced by increasing the number of qubits.


Furthermore, when the number of qubits is sufficiently large, expressive power increases in
the order of su (2), su (2) *[⊗][n]*, so ( *n* ), and su (2 *[n]* ),
implying that expressivity can be improved by
enlarging the dynamical symmetry Lie algebra.

Regarding the trainability of the models, we
estimate the variance of the loss function *L* (Θ)
in the numerical simulation. Note that the
variance of *L* (Θ) is different from Var [ *f* ( **x** *,* Θ)]
listed in Table. 1 as *L* (Θ) is a quadratic function of *f* ( **x** *,* Θ)], and an analytic formula is unavailable. Therefore, we randomly pick 1000
sets of control pulses to numerically evaluate
*L* (Θ) and its variance. Since the variance is
also dependent on the pulse duration *T*, we
make *T* sufficiently long so that the estimated
variance gradually converges to a stationary
value, corresponding to the condition under
which the model approaches a 2-design.
Figure 4(b) illustrates the relation between
the stationary variance and the number of
qubits. Consistent with the theoretical analysis in Tab. 1, the variance related to su (2 *[n]* )
exhibits an exponential decline as the number
of qubits *n* increases, indicating the presence
of a barren plateau. In contrast, the variance
associated with the su (2) symmetry remains
constant owing to its constant dimensionality,
while it decreases at a polynomial rate for the

su(2) *[⊗][n]* and so( *n* ) symmetries.
These observations suggest that barren
plateaus can be effectively avoided by restricting the dynamical evolution to submanifolds within the quantum state Hilbert
space through engineered dynamic symmetry,
thereby achieving a good balance between expressivity and trainability. It is noted that
the overall expressivity and trainability are
highly dependent on the selection of the Hamilton structure, the initial state and the observable. For instance, the expressivity of the
larger so ( *n* ) models is inferior to that of the
smaller su (2) *[⊗][n]* models when the number of
qubits is small, as the latter has more tunable control pulses. Nonetheless, their rates
of decrease align with predictions, indicating
that so ( *n* ) models will become more expressive than su (2) *[⊗][n]* models when *n* is sufficiently
large.
### 5 CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

In conclusion, we established a comprehensive framework for designing practical pulsebased QML models that are both expressive
and trainable. The design incorporates Dyson
polynomial-series expansion alongside existing
Lie algebraic theories related to the barren
plateau phenomenon in quantum systems exhibiting dynamic symmetry. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate

the potential to leverage dynamic symmetry to
construct expressive and trainable pulse-based
models suitable for hardware-efficient deployment on NISQ devices.
It remains an open question whether the
proposed necessary condition is sufficient for
the expressivity of QML models with dynamic
symmetry. Simulation results indicate that
complete expressivity is not always attainable
for models that satisfy this condition, particularly when control pulses are constrained. We
conjecture that sufficiency is achieved when all
control pulses are unrestricted and the pulse
duration is sufficiently long, but this requires
verification in the future.
We also note that, even if the pulse-based
models are expressive and trainable, the loss
landscape may contain undesirable local traps
induced by dynamic symmetry [52], which
can attract the training process to suboptimal models. Although this issue is rarely encountered in our simulations, the possibility remains, and thus the training algorithm needs
to be carefully designed.
Besides the trade-off between model expressivity and trainability, an important issue for
future investigation is their trade-off between
model generalizability, which pertains to the
model’s performance on unseen data. The
overall balance among these three attributes
holds significant practical importance and will
be the focus of subsequent studies.

### A Validation of expressivity and variance calculation for the four examples
#### A.1 Model 1

The Hamiltonian of the model is as follows:

*H* 1 [ *x* ; Θ] = *xJ* z + *θ* 1 ( *t* ) *J* x + *θ* 2 ( *t* ) *J* y *,* (24)


where g = *{iJ* x *, iJ* y *, iJ* z *}* *LA* = su (2) is the 2 *[n]* -dimensional unitary irreducible representation of
su(2). Let *J* *±* = *J* x *± iJ* y be the raising and lowering operators, and

Since the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of *J* z are *±* [2] *[n]* 2 *[−]* [1], and the range of the target

function is chosen to be [ *−* 1 *,* 1], we normalize the observable to *M* = 2 *[n]* 2 *−* 1 *[J]* [z] [. According to]
Theorem 1, it is easy to obtain that

*S* *k* = *{J* x *, J* y *, J* z *}, k ∈* *N.*


If the initial state *|ψ* 0 *⟩* = *|* 0 *⟩* *[⊗][n]*, it can be verified that the model satisfies the condition for
expressivity.
On the other hand, the model is uncontrollable and dim( g ) = 3 . Using the orthonormal basis

#### A.2 Model 2

The Hamiltonian of the model is as follows:

The Lie algebra generated by this model is g = g 1 *⊕· · · ⊕* g *n*, where each g *j* = su (2), thus
dim(g) = 3 *n* . In this case,

*S* *k* = *{σ* x [(] *[i]* [)] *[, σ]* y [(] *[i]* [)] *[, σ]* z [(] *[i]* [)] *[}]* [1] *[≤][i][≤][n]* *[, k][ ∈]* *[N.]*

We can verify that *⟨ψ* 0 *| S* *k* *|ψ* 0 *⟩̸* = *{* 0 *}* for all *k ∈* *N*, which meets the condition in Theorem 1.
Given that the orthonormal basis of g *j* is *i{* 2 *[−][n/]* [2] *σ* x [(] *[j]* [)] *[,]* [ 2] *[−][n/]* [2] *[σ]* y [(] *[j]* [)] *[,]* [ 2] *[−][n/]* [2] *[σ]* z [(] *[j]* [)] *[}]* [, we find] *[ M]* g *j* [=]

*n* 1 *[σ]* z [(] *[j]* [)] [, and] *[ ρ]* g *j* [= 2] *[−][n]* *[σ]* z [(] *[j]* [)] for all *j* . Then we obtain

#### A.3 Model 3

The Hamiltonian of the model is as follows:

*H* 3 [ *x* ; Θ] = *xσ* x [(1)] *[σ]* y [(2)] +

We can derive that

where *σ* [�] x [(] *[i]* [)] *[σ]* y [(] *[j]* [)] = *σ* x [(] *[i]* [)] *[σ]* z [(] *[i]* [+1)] *· · · σ* z [(] *[j][−]* [1)] *σ* y [(] *[j]* [)] [. For the selected initial state] *[ |][ψ]* 0 *[⟩]* [=] *[ |]* [0] *[⟩]* *[⊗]* [(] *[n][−]* [2)] *[ ⊗]* [(] *√* [1] 2 *[|]* [0] *[⟩]* [+]

Theorem 1.
As for the trainability of the model, the Lie algebra associated to this model is g = so ( *n* ) that
has dimension dim(g) = *[n]* [(] *[n]* 2 *[−]* [1] [)] *∈O* (poly( *n* )). Since the orthonormal basis of so( *n* ) is



*[−]* [1] [)]

2 *∈O* (poly( *n* )). Since the orthonormal basis of so( *n* ) is


*{i* 2 *[−][n/]* [2] [ �] *σ* x [(] *[i]* [)] *[σ]* y [(] *[j]* [)] *|* 1 *≤* *i < j ≤* *n},*

we can easily get *P* g ( *M* ) = 2 *[n]* and *P* g ( *ρ* ) = 2 *[−][n]* . Then we have

2
Var [ *f* ( **x** *,* Θ)] =
*n* ( *n −* 1) *[P]* [g] [(] *[ρ]* [)] *[P]* [g] [(] *[M]* [)]

=
*n* ( *n −* 1) *[.]*
#### A.4 Model 4

The model can be verified to possess full expressivity according to the criterion proposed in [22]
because the control Hamiltonians generate the entire su(2 *[n]* ) Lie algebra.
For the calculation of variance, based on the analysis of [41], we have


which yields


*P* g ( *M* ) = 2 *[n]* *,* *P* g ( *ρ* ) = 1 *−* 2 [1] *[n]* *[,]*

1
Var [ *f* ( **x** *,* Θ)] =
2 *[n]* + 1 *[.]*
