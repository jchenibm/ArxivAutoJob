Live streaming platforms have become a dominant form of online
content consumption, offering dynamically evolving content, realtime interactions, and highly engaging user experiences. These
unique characteristics introduce new challenges that differentiate
live streaming recommendation from traditional recommendation
settings and have garnered increasing attention from industry in
recent years. However, research progress in academia has been
hindered by the lack of publicly available datasets that accurately
reflect the dynamic nature of live streaming environments. To address this gap, we introduce KuaiLive, the first real-time, interactive dataset collected from Kuaishou, a leading live streaming
platform in China with over 400 million daily active users. The
dataset records the interaction logs of 23,772 users and 452,621
streamers over a 21-day period. Compared to existing datasets,
KuaiLive offers several advantages: it includes precise live room
start and end timestamps, multiple types of real-time user interactions (click, comment, like, gift), and rich side information features
for both users and streamers. These features enable more realis
tic simulation of dynamic candidate items and better modeling
of user and streamer behaviors. We conduct a thorough analysis
of KuaiLive from multiple perspectives and evaluate several representative recommendation methods on it, establishing a strong
benchmark for future research. KuaiLive can support a wide range
of tasks in the live streaming domain, such as top- *ùêæ* recommendation, click-through rate prediction, watch time prediction, and gift
price prediction. Moreover, its fine-grained behavioral data also
enables research on multi-behavior modeling, multi-task learning,
and fairness-aware recommendation. We believe that KuaiLive will

#### **1 Introduction**

In the era of rapidly evolving streaming services, short video and
live streaming platforms such as Kuaishou and TikTok have attracted tremendous attention and witnessed explosive growth [ 4, 42,
46, 47 ]. Among these, live streaming has emerged as a novel and indispensable form of online service, seamlessly integrating real-time
content broadcasting with immediate social engagement [ 8, 23, 28 ].
In a typical live room, streamers share content in real time while
users actively express their preferences and support through comments, likes, or virtual gifts, fostering a highly dynamic and participatory environment. Despite its rising popularity and practical
importance, live streaming recommendation remains significantly
underexplored in academic research, primarily due to the lack of
publicly available, large-scale, and well-structured datasets that
support systematic investigation and benchmarking. Consequently,
a substantial research gap has emerged between industry practice and academic understanding, hindering the development of
effective and generalizable recommendation models tailored to the
unique characteristics of live streaming scenarios.
Existing representative public recommendation datasets such
as KuaiRec [ 10 ], KuaiSAR [ 33 ], and Tenrec [ 44 ] primarily focus on

short video or general content recommendation tasks. However, live
streaming recommendation differs significantly from traditional
recommendation scenarios, exhibiting several unique characteristics: (1) **Streamers and live rooms are only active during**
**broadcast periods**, resulting in a time-dependent and dynamic
candidate pool that changes continuously over time. (2) **Both live**
**content and user behavior evolve in real time**, users respond to
varying content with diverse feedback signals, such as comments,
likes, and virtual gifts, leading to complex and temporally correlated
interaction patterns. Even datasets specifically designed for live
streaming recommendation such as LiveRec [ 29 ], LSEC [ 42 ], and
KLive [ 7 ] fail to comprehensively capture these dynamic properties.
This highlights the urgent need for a more representative dataset
that reflects the true complexity of live streaming interactions.
To bridge this gap, we introduce KuaiLive, a large-scale realworld dataset for live streaming recommendation. KuaiLive is collected from Kuaishou [1], one of the largest short video and live
streaming platforms in China, with over 400 million daily active
users. On Kuaishou, users can discover and enter live rooms of
interest, where they interact with streamers in real time through
behaviors such as clicking, liking, commenting, following, and sending virtual gifts (as shown in Figure 1). These rich user‚Äìstreamer
interactions make Kuaishou an ideal source for constructing a realistic live streaming recommendation dataset. Compared with existing
public datasets, KuaiLive offers several notable advantages: (1) It
includes the start and end timestamps of each live room, allowing
researchers to simulate realistic live streaming recommendation
settings where candidate items are temporally constrained and dynamically changing. (2) It records multiple user behaviors (e.g., click,
comment, like, gift), which can be leveraged to study multi-task
learning and multi-behavior modeling. (3) It preserves the temporal

order of each interaction, supporting fine-grained analysis of user
behavior trajectories. (4) It includes user watch time and gift price,
enabling broader research tasks beyond recommendation, such as
watch time and gift price prediction. (5) It contains not only positive
feedback but also negative feedback, making it suitable for clickthrough rate (CTR) prediction. (6) It provides not only user and item
IDs but also rich side information features, such as demographics
and attributes, which facilitate feature-aware modeling.
Notably, KuaiLive is the first publicly available live streaming
dataset that captures rich and realistic sequences of user interactions within an interactive app environment. This makes it a
valuable resource for advancing research in live streaming recommendation, including but not limited to top- *ùêæ* recommendation and
CTR prediction. In addition, thanks to its fine-grained behavioral
information, KuaiLive also enables a wide range of research tasks,
such as watch time prediction, gift price prediction, multi-task
learning, and fairness-aware recommendation.
#### **2 Related Work** **2.1 Live Streaming Recommendation**

Recently, live streaming has emerged as a prominent form of social
media, attracting increasing attention from researchers.
Owing to its inherently multi-modal nature, which includes text,
images, and audio, numerous studies have focused on the effective integration of these diverse signals. For instance, MTA [ 39 ]
and ContentCTR [ 5 ] propose approaches for multi-modal fusion to
enhance recommendation performance. Building on the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), LARM [ 24 ] leverages
multi-modal LLMs to generate aligned embeddings, effectively capturing the temporal dynamics distinctive to live streaming scenarios.
Beyond fusion techniques, MMBee [ 8 ] introduces a graph learning
method to enrich representations of both users and streamers by
incorporating multi-modal attributes from gifting graphs.
E-commerce live streaming, a widely adopted functional streaming category, has also attracted significant interest due to its distinctive tripartite interactions among users, streamers, and products.
For instance, LSEC-GNN [ 42 ] models this tripartite relationship
as a heterogeneous graph to enhance product recommendation.
Similarly, eLiveRec [ 48 ] treats user behaviors in the live and product domains as cross-domain signals and employs a disentangled
encoder to capture both shared and domain-specific intents, leading
to more effective e-commerce recommendations.
In addition, LiveRec [ 29 ] observes that repeat consumption is
a common behavior in live streaming scenarios and emphasizes
the importance of modeling temporal dynamics. To better capture
diverse interaction patterns, MRB4LS [ 53 ] constructs three bipartite
graphs based on different types of repeated user behaviors. LiveForesighter [ 25 ] further analyzes inter-behavior correlations to predict
potential future actions, enabling more precise recommendations.
Some recent studies have also begun focusing on the evolving
nature of live streaming content. Sliver [ 23 ] proposes modifications
to the data stream format for enhancing the capture of real-time
dynamics, while KuaiHL [ 7 ] introduces a multimodal framework
to identify and predict highlight moments within live rooms.
Given that many platforms offer both short video and live streaming services, several works explore how to leverage short video

the Full version, which includes live room information, although such details
are not explicitly presented in the paper and require manual extraction.

data to enhance live streaming recommendations. For instance, Moment&Cross [ 1 ] integrates short video signals to capture user preferences more comprehensively, while FARM [ 21 ] proposes crossdomain preference alignment and fusion modules. MGCCDR [ 28 ]
constructs multiple bipartite graphs to bridge the non-overlapping
entities between short videos and live streamers, enabling effective
cross-domain information transfer.

Despite these advances, most of the aforementioned methods
are developed on proprietary industrial datasets, which limits reproducibility and hinders progress in the academic community. The
lack of publicly available datasets has become a major bottleneck
for further research in live streaming recommendation.
#### **2.2 Related Datasets**

Datasets serve as the foundation for both developing and evaluating
recommendation algorithms. The availability and quality of datasets
play a crucial role in shaping model design, training strategies, and
evaluation protocols. To the best of our knowledge, only three
public datasets have been released specifically for live streaming
recommendation. Below, we briefly introduce each of them:

 - LiveRec [ 29 ] is the first publicly available live streaming recommendation dataset, collected from Twitch [2] over a 43-day period in
July 2019. It records the watch time of users in live rooms. LiveRec
has two versions: Bench and Full. The Bench version is a random

sample of 100,000 users from the Full version, while the Full version
contains more complete user‚Äìstreamer interaction data.

 - LSEC [ 42 ] is an e-commerce live streaming recommendation
dataset, collected from an e-commerce platform between December
1, 2020, and January 19, 2021. It captures user behaviors such as
following and purchasing products during e-commerce live rooms.
LSEC also has two versions: Small and Large.

 - Klive [ 7 ] is a recently released dataset for highlight detection in
live streaming, collected from a well-known live streaming platform.
It contains information about streamers and live rooms, along with
textual and multimodal features of the live sessions.

While these datasets have contributed to the development of
live streaming recommendation, they suffer from several notable

limitations: the absence of live room lifecycle information, the inability to capture diverse user behaviors within a live room, and
the restriction to only ID-level fields. These limitations hinder their
ability to reflect the dynamics of real-world live streaming scenarios. The comparison between KuaiLive and these datasets is
presented in Table 1. Compared with existing datasets, KuaiLive
offers a more comprehensive and fine-grained view of the live
streaming ecosystem by simultaneously incorporating information
from three parties: users, streamers, and rooms, along with multiple
types of user interactions. It also records the lifecycle of each live
room, including start and end timestamps, allowing for modeling of
the evolving candidate set in real scenarios. Beyond basic ID-level
attributes, KuaiLive provides rich side information features and
real user interactions, covering various types of positive feedback
( *e.g.,* click, comment, like, gift) and negative feedback.
#### **3 The KuaiLive Dataset**

In this section, we present a comprehensive overview of the
KuaiLive dataset. We begin by introducing the characteristics of the
Kuaishou app to provide background and context for the dataset.
Next, we describe the data construction process in detail. Finally,
we summarize the KuaiLive dataset by highlighting its scale and
the diverse features it contains, laying the foundation for future
research on live streaming recommendation.
#### **3.1 Characteristics of Kuaishou App**

Kuaishou is one of the largest short video and live streaming platforms in China, boasting over 400 million daily active users who
spend an average of nearly 133.8 minutes on the app each day. In
recent years, live streaming has experienced rapid growth, becoming an integral part of daily life and emerging as one of Kuaishou‚Äôs
core services. Notably, revenue from live streaming contributes
approximately 30% of the company‚Äôs total income, highlighting its
significant commercial potential.
Unlike platforms such as Taobao [3], which focuses on e-commerce
live streaming, or Twitch, which is centered on gaming content,
Kuaishou offers a diverse range of live streaming content spanning
e-commerce, education, gaming, fitness, and more. This diversity
has attracted a broad user base and fostered active engagement in
live interactions. Such a solid ecosystem provides a strong foundation for constructing the live streaming recommendation dataset.
We illustrate the live streaming service on Kuaishou in Figure 1.
On the right side, the live streaming section adopts a two-column
layout, where users can scroll vertically to explore recommended
live streams and click a thumbnail to enter a live room of interest.

On the left side, Kuaishou integrates live streams with short videos
in a unified single-column feed. As users browse short videos, if
the content creator is currently live, they can enter the live room
by clicking the profile picture. In this setting, the next item in the
feed could be either a short video or a live stream, depending on
the recommender system. Once users enter a live stream, they
can engage in a variety of interactive behaviors with the streamer,
including following, liking, commenting, and sending virtual gifts.
These rich and diverse interactions are all recorded in KuaiLive to

reflect real-world live streaming scenarios.

#### **3.2 Data Construction**

To address the limitations of existing datasets and support research
on live streaming recommendation, we construct KuaiLive based on
real-world user behaviors from the Chinese live streaming platform
Kuaishou. The dataset construction process is illustrated as follows.
**User Sampling.** To ensure both the representativeness and
behavioral diversity of users in KuaiLive, we randomly sample
approximately 25,000 active users who engaged in all four types
of interactions (click, comment, like, and gift) in the live streaming
domain of the Kuaishou app between May 5, 2025, and May 25,
2025. Users exhibiting irregular or abnormal interaction patterns
are filtered out to maintain the quality of the dataset. After filtering,
we retain a total of 23,772 unique user IDs.
**Interaction Collection.** We collect multiple types of finegrained user interactions from the live streaming service logs over
a 21-day period, spanning from May 5 to May 25, 2025. These interactions include four behavior types: click, comment, like, and gift.
Each interaction is associated with a precise timestamp, enabling
the study of temporal behavior patterns in live streaming scenarios.
Since users may have already followed a streamer before clicking a
live room, the absence of a follow action within the room does not
necessarily indicate a lack of interest. Therefore, we do not record
the follow behavior in this dataset. In addition to these explicit
feedback signals, we also record auxiliary signals such as watch
time and gift price to support more fine-grained analyses. Moreover, to support tasks like CTR prediction, we also include negative
feedback, referring to live rooms that were exposed but skipped
by users. Through this process, we obtain interactions involving
452,621 unique streamers and 11,613,708 live rooms.
**Side Information Collection.** To further enhance the utility
and realism of KuaiLive, we collect extensive side information for all
three core entities: users, streamers, and live rooms. As summarized
in Table 2, the dataset includes 20 user features, 23 streamer features,
and 5 room features, covering a diverse set of attributes such as
demographics, content characteristics, and behavioral summaries.
For time-sensitive features such as fans_num, we standardize their
values by taking consistent snapshots as of May 25, 2025, to ensure temporal coherence across the dataset. With these features,
researchers can explore a broader range of tasks using this dataset.
For example, the inclusion of start and end timestamps for each live
room allows for modeling dynamic candidate item pools, closely
reflecting real-world live streaming scenarios.


**Anonymization.** Given that KuaiLive is collected from a commercial live streaming platform, strict anonymization procedures
are applied to ensure compliance with data-releasing policies and
to protect user privacy. Specifically, all identifiers such as user
IDs, streamer IDs, and live room IDs are randomly hashed into
anonymized integer values, thereby removing any direct traceability. For sensitive timestamp information, we apply systematic
offsetting and rounding techniques to obscure exact timings while
retaining meaningful temporal patterns for research. In addition,
textual data such as live room titles are first encoded into dense
vectors using a pre-trained embedding model, and then reduced
in dimensionality to prevent potential information leakage. These
anonymization strategies effectively safeguard the dataset from
containing any personally identifiable or sensitive content, while
preserving the data‚Äôs utility for research purposes.
#### **3.3 Statistics**

We provide a comprehensive overview of the key statistics in
KuaiLive to help researchers understand its scale and characteristics. As shown in Table 2, the dataset consists of 23,772 users,
452,621 streamers, and 11,613,708 live rooms. It is important to
note that not all live rooms were actually interacted with by users.
While we ensure that each streamer has at least one associated user

interaction, a single streamer may host multiple live rooms during
the observation period, and only a subset of these rooms received
user engagement. Over the 21-day collection window, KuaiLive
records a total of 5,357,998 user interactions on the Kuaishou app,
covering four behavior types: click, comment, like, and gift. It is
evident that compared to click interactions, the other behaviors are
relatively rare ‚Äî especially gifts, which account for only 1.5% of the
number of clicks. This is largely due to the high cost associated with
virtual gifting. Such a distribution highlights the extreme sparsity
of gifting interactions in live streaming scenarios, reflecting the inherent challenges of modeling user intent and engagement in such
scenarios. We believe this underexplored yet practically important
scenario deserves more attention from the research community.

#### **4 Dataset Analysis**

In this section, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the KuaiLive
dataset from three aspects: 1) demographics, 2) streamer activity
analysis, and 3) user interaction behaviors. This analysis helps reveal key characteristics of the live streaming scenario and provides
valuable insights for downstream recommendation tasks.
#### **4.1 Demographics**

We first analyze the demographics of the 23,772 users and 452,621
streamers in KuaiLive. Among users, 61.85% are male, while the
remaining 38.15% are female, slightly more male-skewed compared
to the overall user base of the app. In terms of age distribution,
43.93% of users are young adults aged between 18 and 40, 16.93%
are minors under the age of 18, and the remaining users are over
40 years old. For streamers, the demographic distribution shows
a different trend. 62.83% of streamers are female, and 62.01% are
young adults aged between 18 and 40, only 0.93% of streamers
are under 18, while 37.06% are over 40 years old. Additionally,
KuaiLive covers a wide variety of 13 streamer types, including Chat,
E-Commerce, Beauty, Lifestyle, Talent, Education, Relationship,
Game, Hobbies, Fitness, Group, News, and Other. Since the data is
collected from the Chinese version of the Kuaishou app rather than
the international version (Kwai), the majority of users and streamers
are based in China. While the dataset includes IP addresses from

83 different countries, over 99% of users and streamers are from
China, with a small portion coming from South Korea and Japan.
#### **4.2 Streamer Activity Analysis**

In this section, we investigate the behavioral characteristics and
popularity patterns of streamers in the KuaiLive dataset. We begin by analyzing the distribution of user interactions received by
streamers, followed by an examination of the long-tail effect in
engagement concentration, and conclude with a temporal analysis
of streaming activity to reveal daily broadcasting rhythms.
**Streamer Engagement Distribution.** First, we analyze the
distribution of interaction frequency per streamer in the KuaiLive
dataset, as shown in Figure 2(a). The results exhibit a severe imbalance: approximately 70% of streamers receive fewer than 5 user
interactions, while only 4.6% receive more than 40 interactions. This
finding highlights a widespread cold-start issue for the majority
of streamers, which poses significant challenges for visibility and


engagement. Moreover, it suggests that commonly adopted preprocessing strategies such as 5-core filtering method, which exclude
users or items with fewer than five interactions, may disrupt the
continuity of real-world user behavior and introduce discrepancies
in recommendation performance when compared to models trained
on the complete data.
**Long-tail Popularity Distribution.** Building upon the above
observation, we further examine the cumulative distribution of total
interactions per streamer to validate the presence of a long-tail effect, as illustrated in Figure 2(b). The results reveal a highly skewed
distribution, where a small fraction of top streamers dominate user
attention. Notably, the top 10 most popular streamers alone account
for over 1.5% of all interactions in the KuaiLive. This head-heavy
phenomenon presents challenges for fairness-aware recommendation, particularly in ensuring that new or less-followed streamers
receive adequate exposure. Failing to address this imbalance risks
discouraging emerging content creators, which can ultimately hinder streamer retention and limit the diversity of content available
on the platform. Therefore, developing mechanisms to mitigate this
skew and ensure more equitable exposure is essential for fostering
a healthier, more inclusive, and sustainable ecosystem.
**Temporal Streaming Behaviors.** Finally, we investigate the
streaming activity of streamers across different times of the day.
Specifically, we examine the hourly distribution of live stream initiations over a 24-hour period to uncover streamers‚Äô temporal activity
patterns. As illustrated in Figure 2(c), the number of live rooms
increases significantly during the evening hours, with a noticeable
peak between 6 PM and 10 PM. In contrast, far fewer live rooms are
initiated between 11 PM and 8 AM the next morning. This trend
indicates that streamers tend to schedule their broadcasts during
times of high user availability, likely to maximize audience engagement. This temporal variation in streaming activity leads to uneven
distributions in candidate items across different time slots. Therefore, it is essential for recommender systems to incorporate such
temporal patterns into their modeling process to adaptively adjust
recommendation strategies and maintain effective performance.
#### **4.3 User Interaction Analysis**

In this section, we analyze the behavioral characteristics of users in
the KuaiLive dataset. We start by examining the overall distribution
of user interactions to understand user activity levels, then explore
the temporal dynamics of user engagement throughout the day, and

finally investigate repeat consumption behaviors, highlighting their
widespread occurrence and significance in live streaming scenario.
**User Engagement Distribution.** We first examine the overall
distribution of user interactions. As shown in Figure 3(a), although
the imbalance is less severe compared to streamers, it still remains
prominent: 43.8% of users have fewer than 50 interactions, while
12.6% of users are highly active. This presents two main challenges
for recommender systems. For users with limited interactions, it
is difficult to construct accurate user profiles due to the cold-start
problem. On the other hand, for highly active users with diverse behaviors, identifying their core interests from a large and potentially
noisy interaction history becomes equally challenging.
**Temporal User Activity.** Next, we analyze user engagement
patterns over a 24-hour period to understand temporal variations
in user activity. As shown in Figure 3(b), user interactions peak
during the evening hours, particularly between 6 PM and 12 AM,
aligning closely with the active streaming hours of streamers. In
contrast, engagement is relatively low during the early morning
hours. Interestingly, there is also a smaller peak around 12 PM,
which may correspond to users watching live streams during their
lunch break as a form of relaxation. These observations suggest
that user behavior is closely tied to daily routines and that user
preferences may vary across different times of the day. For instance,
food-related streams may gain more traction around noon, aligning with mealtimes, while gaming content often dominates in the
evening, when users are more inclined to engage in leisure-oriented
activities after work or school. These temporal dynamics indicate
that real-time recommender systems should consider time-sensitive
user preferences to improve relevance and effectiveness.
**Repeat Consumption Behavior.** Finally, we examine repeat
consumption behaviors in the live streaming scenario to gain deeper
insights into user engagement patterns. As illustrated in Figure 3(c),
27.1% of users interact with the same streamers multiple times, indicating that repeat consumption is a prevalent phenomenon in live
streaming. This contrasts with domains such as movies and books,
where users typically consume each item only once, highlighting
the unique, ongoing nature of user‚Äìstreamer interactions in live
streaming scenarios. We further analyze the time intervals between
repeat interactions and observe a clear periodic pattern, often occurring on a daily basis. This suggests that users tend to revisit
familiar streamers regularly, possibly due to habit formation or
alignment with scheduled broadcast times. These consistent behavioral patterns underscore the importance of capturing long-term


user preferences and temporal rhythms when developing effective
recommendation strategies for live streaming platforms.
#### **5 Benchmarked Results and Analysis**

In this section, we present the performance of representative baseline methods on top- *ùêæ* recommendation and CTR prediction tasks.
#### **5.1 Experimental Setups**

*5.1.1* *Datasets.* We conduct our experiments on click behavior, as
it provides the most abundant interaction data. In existing studies,
there are two common ways to define the recommended items: as
either live rooms or streamers [ 29 ]. The key distinction lies in their
stability: streamer IDs remain consistent across sessions, while each
live room is uniquely associated with a single session. Consequently,
interactions with streamers form denser records, whereas those
with live rooms are inherently sparser, posing a greater challenge
for recommendation models. To better understand the impact of
these settings, we evaluate both item definitions in our experiments.

*5.1.2* *Evaluation Protocol.* For evaluating top- *ùêæ* recommendation
methods, we adopt a standard leave-one-out splitting strategy. Since
most top- *ùêæ* recommendation methods only rely on ID information,
we do not incorporate any user or item features in the training
and evaluation. To better simulate the real-world environment, we
first identify candidate items that were active at the time of each
interaction based on their start and end timestamps. Then, for each
instance in the validation and test sets, we sample 10,000 negative
items from this candidate pool. Benchmarked models are evaluated
using Recall@{5, 10, 20} and NDCG@{5, 10, 20}.
To evaluate CTR prediction methods, we combine positive and
negative samples and split the data based on interaction timestamps
into training, validation, and testing sets with a ratio of 8:1:1. For
user features, we include genre, age, and follow_num. For streamer
features, we use genre, age, live_operation_tag, and fans_num. We
adopt Area Under Curve (AUC) and LogLoss as evaluation metrics.

*5.1.3* *Benchmarked Approaches.* For top- *ùêæ* recommendation, we
select representative baselines from three categories: general collaborative filtering methods (BPRMF [ 31 ], NeuMF [ 13 ], LightGCN [ 12 ],
DirectAU [ 35 ]), sequential methods (GRU4Rec [ 14 ], SASRec [ 16 ],
NARM [ 19 ], Caser [ 36 ]), and time-aware methods (TiSASRec [ 20 ]).
For CTR prediction, we benchmark a set of widely-used models,
including FM [ 30 ], Wide&Deep [ 3 ], DeepFM [ 11 ], xDeepFM [ 22 ],
DCN [37], DCNv2 [38], DIN [52], and DIEN [51].

*5.1.4* *Implementation Details.* All benchmarked approaches are
implemented using the ReChorus [5] [ 18 ] library. To ensure fair comparison, we standardize the embedding size to 64 and the batch
size to 2048 across all models. All methods are optimized using the
Adam optimizer, with a grid search performed over the learning
rate { 1 *ùëí* ‚Äì 3 *,* 1 *ùëí* ‚Äì 4 *,* 5 *ùëí* ‚Äì 4 *,* 1 *ùëí* ‚Äì 5 } and weight decay { 1 *ùëí* ‚Äì 5 *,* 1 *ùëí* ‚Äì 6 *,* 1 *ùëí* ‚Äì 7 },
while keeping other hyperparameters as the default settings provided by ReChorus. For the loss functions, we adopt BPR loss for
top- *ùêæ* recommendation tasks and binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss
for CTR prediction. In sequential recommendation methods, the
maximum user interaction history length is set to 50. All experiments are conducted on NVIDIA Tesla V100 32G GPUs.
#### **5.2 Experimental Results**

*5.2.1* *Top-* *ùêæ* *Recommendation.* Table 3 presents the overall results
of different recommendation methods on KuaiLive. From the experimental results, we have the following observations and conclusions:
When the recommended items are streamers, LightGCN performs worse than other collaborative filtering-based methods, possibly due to the limited scalability of GNN-based approaches on
large-scale datasets. Moreover, sequential recommendation methods outperform general collaborative filtering-based methods in

most cases. This may be attributed to the fact that users often watch
the same streamer or relevant streamers, resulting in sequential
behavioral patterns that sequential models are better equipped to
capture. Furthermore, time-aware methods such as TiSASRec outperform non-temporal baselines, underscoring the importance of
modeling temporal signals in this scenario. Given the time-sensitive
nature of content relevance and user engagement in live scenarios,
incorporating temporal dynamics proves especially beneficial.
When the recommended items are live rooms, we observe a significant drop in performance. This can be attributed to the fact that
live rooms only exist during the streaming session, and many of
them lack interaction history, making them cold-start items. Even if
a user has previously watched the same streamer multiple times, it
is still difficult to generate accurate recommendations based solely
on the ID of a newly initiated live room. Moreover, collaborative
filtering-based methods outperform sequential recommendation
models in this setting. This is because user behavior sequences
often do not reflect repeated consumption of the same streamer,
making it harder for sequential models to capture user preferences
effectively. These findings highlight the importance of modeling
the relationship between live rooms and streamers to improve recommendation accuracy under such dynamic and sparse conditions.

*5.2.2* *CTR Prediction.* Table 4 presents the overall results of various CTR prediction methods on KuaiLive. Consistent with the
observations in the top- *ùêæ* recommendation task, we find that the
performance degrades when the recommended items are live rooms
rather than streamers, especially for models like DIN and DIEN that
rely heavily on users‚Äô historical behavior sequences. Moreover, the
performance of most CTR models remains relatively similar across
the board. This may be due to the use of only sparse features, as
required by anonymity constraints, which limits the models‚Äô ability
to leverage richer semantic information typically carried by dense
features. As a result, methods that rely on the effective fusion of
sparse and dense features may fail to realize their full potential.
#### **6 Potential Research Directions**

Based on the rich user behaviors and multi-granular features provided in KuaiLive, we summarize a range of potential research
directions that this dataset can support:


-----

Conference acronym ‚ÄôXX, June 03‚Äì05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Changle Qu, Sunhao Dai, Ke Guo, Liqin Zhao, Yanan Niu, Xiao Zhang, and Jun Xu


**Top-** *ùêæ* **Recommendation.** This is a fundamental task in recommender systems, aiming to generate a ranked list of the top- *ùêæ* most
suitable items for each user. Leveraging the abundant interaction
records and precise timestamps provided by KuaiLive, researchers
can explore a wide range of recommendation techniques, including collaborative filtering [ 12, 13, 35 ], sequential recommendation

[ 14, 16, 19, 34 ], and time-aware recommendation strategies [ 20, 36 ].
**XTR Prediction.** Beyond top- *ùêæ* recommendation, industrial
applications often emphasize X-Through-Rate (XTR) prediction
tasks [ 1 ], where X refers to specific interaction types, such as ClickThrough Rate (CTR) or Gift-Through Rate (GTR). CTR prediction focuses on estimating the likelihood of a user clicking a recommended
item [ 5, 26, 49 ], while GTR prediction estimates the likelihood of
a user sending gifts during a live room [ 8, 25 ]. KuaiLive not only
provides abundant positive samples for various user behaviors but
also includes negative samples, such as unclicked items for CTR
and non-gifted items for GTR. These features enable a wide range
of XTR modeling and evaluation scenarios.
**Watch Time Prediction.** In real-world industrial applications,
predicting how long a user will stay in a live room is essential for
measuring user engagement. Watch time is often adopted as a key
metric in A/B testing [ 1, 25 ], reflecting the effectiveness of recommendation strategies. This task supports a range of downstream
applications such as personalized scheduling, server resource allocation, and streamer performance evaluation. The detailed records
of user watch time provided in KuaiLive offer a reliable foundation
for developing and evaluating watch time prediction models.
**Gift Price Prediction.** Gifting represents a central commercial
behavior in live streaming scenarios [ 8, 39 ], serving as a major
source of income for both streamers and platforms. Compared to
tasks like watch time prediction, gift price prediction poses greater
challenges due to the high sparsity and skewed distribution of gift
transactions‚Äîmost gifts are of low value, while high-value gifts occur rarely but contribute disproportionately to revenue. Accurately
estimating user potential gift spending is vital for optimizing monetization strategies and enabling precise user profiling. KuaiLive
includes detailed records of gift prices, presenting valuable opportunities to investigate this emerging yet underexplored task in depth.
**Multi-behavior Modeling.** Users typically exhibit multiple
types of interactions in recommender systems. For example, in ecommerce platforms, common behaviors include view, cart, and
buy; in live streaming platforms, behaviors extend to click, comment, like, and gift. Effectively modeling the relationships among
these diverse behaviors has become a research hotspot [ 15, 43, 45 ],
as it enables more accurate and context-aware recommendations.

KuaiLive provides rich multi-type user behavior data, offering a
solid foundation for advancing multi-behavior modeling.
**Controllable Learning and Recommendation.** Real-world
recommender systems often need to optimize for multiple objectives simultaneously, such as CTR, GTR, long-view ratio, and total watch time [ 21, 24 ]. Beyond training multi-objective models,
a critical challenge lies in test-time controllability: the ability to
dynamically rebalance these objectives in response to real-time,
context-dependent needs from users or the platform during inference ‚Äî e.g., prioritizing GTR amid surges in interactive engagement
or boosting long-tail streamer visibility to improve new user retention [ 2, 32 ]. The KuaiLive dataset offers a rich set of user behaviors


and labels, making it well-suited for building and evaluating controllable learning and recommendation architectures in the context
of live streaming recommendation.
**Cold-start Recommendation.** In real-world applications, new
users are constantly joining the platform, and many users may
have limited interaction histories. Cold-start recommendation aims

to provide relevant item suggestions for these users with sparse
behavioral data, a long-standing and unresolved problem in recommender systems [ 9, 17 ]. The KuaiLive dataset includes all users
and streamers without filtering based on interaction frequency,
thereby retaining a substantial proportion of cold-start cases. This
characteristic makes KuaiLive a valuable resource for studying and
benchmarking cold-start recommendation strategies.
**Fairness-aware Recommendation.** To build a more equitable
and sustainable live streaming platform, it is essential to consider
not only the user experience but also the experience and retention
of streamers. As analyzed in Section 4.2, a small number of top
streamers receive the majority of user interactions, while many
other streamers gain minimal visibility. Fairness-aware recommendation aims to mitigate systematic biases toward popular streamers
and promote the exposure and recommendation opportunities of
less popular streamers [ 40, 41 ]. KuaiLive not only provides detailed
interaction records for streamers but also includes additional fea
tures such as follower counts, which are crucial for developing and
evaluating fairness-aware recommendation strategies.
**End-to-end Generative Recommendation.** With the rapid advancement of LLMs, recent studies have begun to explore breaking
away from the traditional multi-stage recommendation paradigm
by employing generative models to produce recommendations in
an end-to-end manner [ 6, 27, 50 ]. Since items in live streaming
scenarios are only available during their broadcast periods, the
resulting candidate pool is dynamically changing and much smaller
than in other domains, making this scenario especially well-suited
for end-to-end generative recommendation. KuaiLive includes precise records of live room start and end timestamps, enabling the
simulation of temporally varying candidate pools and facilitating
research of end-to-end generative recommendation.
#### **7 Conclusion**

In this work, we propose a large-scale real-world live streaming dataset, KuaiLive, comprising over 23,772 users and 452,621
streamers collected from Kuaishou. Different from existing datasets,
KuaiLive records the start and end timestamps of live rooms, captures various user behaviors within the live rooms, and includes

rich features for both users and streamers. These characteristics

make KuaiLive more representative of real-world live streaming
recommendation scenarios. We further analyze the dataset from
both the streamer and user perspectives to reveal the unique characteristics of live streaming scenarios and provide insights that
can inform the design of more effective recommendation models.
Furthermore, we evaluate a wide range of representative recommendation and CTR prediction methods on KuaiLive, establishing
a robust and reproducible benchmark for future research. Finally,
we outline several potential research directions that KuaiLive can
support. We believe KuaiLive will serve as a valuable resource for
advancing the study of live streaming recommendation.
